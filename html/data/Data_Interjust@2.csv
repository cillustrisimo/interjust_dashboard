It also establishes active personality jurisdiction with respect to the crimes committed by our citizens outside the territory of Albania and the protective jurisdictions with respect to some specified crimes against the interest of the Albanian state or an Albanian citizen.

In accordance with Article 7/a of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Albanian, universal jurisdicition may be exercised by a competent Albanian court in order to try a person duly accussed of commiting serious crimes under international law. According to this provision, the enactment of the principle of universal jurisdiction is established in two ways: Firstly through the provision of the universal jurisdiction for a category of serious crimes, which must amount to a) crimes against humanity; b) war crimes, c) genocide d) crimes with terrorist purposes, e) torture, as stipulated expressively in the Albanian Criminal Code. Secondly, through the applicability of the criminal law of the Republic of Albania to a foreigner who commits outside of the territory of the Republic of Albania one of the criminal offenses for which specific laws or international agreements, in which Albania is party, provide the applicability of Albanian criminal law. However, in the case of universal jurisdiction, the criminal code of the Republic of Albania, in its article 7(a), limits the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction to the establishment of two factors: first the establishment of the fact that the foreigner who has committed the crime outside the territory of Albania is present in the territory of Albanian and second, the alleged offender is not extradited. ...

The Argentine justice system has repeatedly exercised universal jurisdiction based on the seriousness of the crimes, particularly in relation to genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and serious violations of human rights. In Argentine judicial practice, universal jurisdiction is applied in a subsidiary and exceptional manner to the principle of territoriality and personality, after considering that the crimes were not judged or could not be judged by the States in whose territories the crimes were committed or by the States of nationality of the perpetrator or the victims. Also as a matter of practice, before applying universal jurisdiction, Argentine judicial authorities first rule out the possibility that there are no ongoing investigations in the country or countries involved and that an International Criminal Court is investigating the facts. ... Argentina's Myanmar Case (2019) In November 2019, the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), a UK-based NGO, filed a criminal complaint before an Argentine court against senior Myanmar officials for crimes against humanity and genocide allegedly committed against members of the Rohingya community in Myanmar between 2016 and 2018. On July 12, 2021, a lower court in Argentina ruled that Argentine courts were not the appropriate forum to adjudicate crimes committed against the Rohingya because (1) the OTP was already investigating crimes against the Rohingya and (2) Argentina lacked a cultural nexus to the situation in Myanmar. The lower court also rejected the legal standing of all of the complainants––including BROUK because it was not registered in Argentina. On November 26, 2021, an Argentine appellate court overturned the lower court's decision, resumed proceedings, and held in the Myanmar case that (1) the Argentine Criminal Procedure Code allow for a complainant organization’s registration in a country other than Argentina; (2) the investigation before the International Criminal Court had a limited scope (and Myanmar is not a State Party to the ICC), such that an investigation by the Argentine court system into the events that harmed the Rohingya community in Myanmar specifically would not be incompatible with the OTP’s investigation; and (3) there need not be a cultural consideration requirement. Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2018) ... Explicit references to universal jurisdiction in treaty law are limited. Some of the multilateral instruments that expressly include it are the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (articles 49, 50, 129 and 146, respectively), the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (article 28), the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (article 105) and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (article V). ... In practice, the Argentine Republic has accepted the principle of universal jurisdiction on several occasions by initiating investigations in Argentina into crimes that are considered delicti jus gentium, even if they were committed outside Argentina and neither the principle of nationality nor the protective principle applies. It has done so in application of article 118 of its Constitution, of the international obligations assumed under existing human rights treaties that have been incorporated into the Constitution by means of article 75, paragraph 22, and of the universal right of access to justice. Furthermore, the Argentine courts have applied the principle of universal jurisdiction after reviewing whether the alleged events have already been adjudicated or investigated by other competent courts. In all such cases, the courts have justified their intervention based on subsidiary universal jurisdiction, that is, after determining that the crimes had not been prosecuted or that prosecution had not been possible. The Supreme Court has stated that the State is no longer authorized to make decisions that result in a waiver of criminal prosecution (the 2005 case concerning Simón, Julio H. et al). ...

As a result of the combined analysis of the provisions of parts 3 and 4 of Article 15 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia, it can be concluded that the principle of universal jurisdiction applies in case of simultaneous existence of the following conditions: (1) the person having committed the criminal offence is a foreign national or a stateless person not permanently residing in the Republic of Armenia; (2) the offence has been committed outside the territory of the Republic of Armenia; (3) the crime is provided for by international treaties of the Republic of Armenia; (4) the person having committed the criminal offence has not been subjected to criminal liability in another state; (5) the person having committed the criminal offence is in the Republic of Armenia for some reasons and he/she has been caught and is being subjected to criminal liability in the territory of the Republic of Armenia. The Republic of Armenia has ratified a number of international treaties, which provide for an obligation on member states to criminalise certain crimes. For the performance of international obligations, crimes have been provided for by the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia, in case of committing whereof foreign nationals and stateless persons not permanently residing in the Republic of Armenia, having committed a criminal offence outside the territory of the Republic of Armenia, will — by virtue of universal principle of operation of the criminal law — be subjected to criminal liability according to the Criminal Code of Republic of Armenia. Thus, the jurisdiction of the Republic of Armenia will extend to the following crimes: ...  aggressive war (Article 384), public calls for aggressive war (Article 385), proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (Article 386), employing prohibited means and methods of warfare (Article 387), terrorist act against a representative of a foreign state or an international organisation (Article 388), international terrorism (Article 389), grave violations of the rules of international humanitarian law in time of armed conflicts (Article 390), failure to act or issuing a criminal order in time of armed conflicts (Article 391), crimes against the safety of humanity (Article 392), genocide (Article 393), direct and public incitement to genocide (Article 393.1) ... ... Armenia's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... ( a) National legislation concerning universal jurisdiction: The issues concerning the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction are regulated by the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia (hereinafter referred to as ""CCRA"") and the Criminal Procedure Code of the Republic of Armenia (hereinafter referred to as ""CPCRA''). According to Article 14 of the CCRA, a person who commits a crime in the territory of the Republic of Armenia is subject to liability under the CCRA. In cases of crimes committed in the territory of the Republic of Armenia and other states, the person's liability arises under the CCRA, if the person was subjected to criminal liability in the territory of the Republic of Armenia , unless an international treaty of the Republic of Armenia prescribes otherwise. Article 3 of the CPCRA states that in the territory of the Republic of Armenia, proceedings in criminal cases shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of CPCRA, irrespective of the place where the crime was committed, unless otherwise prescribed by the international treaties of the Republic of Armenia. Upon the motion of foreign courts or investigation agencies, a criminal procedure code of such foreign country may apply to certain investigative or court actions, if so provided by international treaties of the Republic of Armenia. The Article 15 of the CCRA stipulates that a citizen of the Republic of Armenia or stateless person permanently residing in the Republic of Armenia who commits a crime outside of the territory of the Republic of Armenia, is subject to criminal liability under the CCRA, if the act committed by such person is recognized as a crime in the legislation of the foreign country where the crime was committed, and if such person has not been convicted by foreign country for that crime. When convicting the above mentioned persons, the punishment can not exceed the upper limit for punishment in the state where the crime was committed. However, for certain crimes, such as genocide, terrorism, ecocide, production or proliferation of mass destruction weapons and application of prohibited methods of war, such persons are subject to criminal liability regardless whether the act is considered a crime or not in the foreign country where the crime was committed. A foreign citizen or stateless person not permanently residing in the Republic of Armenia, who commits a crime outside the territory of the Republic of Armenia, is subject to criminal liability under the CCRA, if such person commits: (1) such crimes which are provided in an international treaty of the Republic of Armenia, or (2) such grave and particularly grave crimes which are directed against the interests of the Republic of Armenia or the rights and freedoms of the citizens of the Republic of Armenia, and if such person has not been convicted by a foreign country for that crime and is subjected to criminal liability in the territory of the Republic of Armenia. CCRA states that a citizen of the Republic of Armenia who commits a crime in a foreign country cannot be extradited to that foreign country. In accordance with an international treaty of the Republic of Armenia, a foreign citizen or stateless person in the territory of the Republic of Armenia, who commits a crime outside the territory of the Republic of Armenia, can be extradited to a foreign state. A person cannot be extradited to a foreign country if there are serious reasons to believe that that person can be subjected to torture. If the legislation of the country seeking extradition of a person who commits a crime envisages death penalty for the given crime, then the extradition of such person can be turned down, unless the country seeking extradition presents satisfying assurances to the extraditing country that the death penalty will not be carried out. In case of refusal to extradite the person who committed a crime, the prosecution for the crime committed in the territory of a foreign country is done in accordance with the CCRA.

There is no requirement that the victim or the perpetrator be an Australian citizen, resident or body corporate.]",Yes,"Australia's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2018) ... Implementation of the principle of universal jurisdiction into Australian law In order to have effect in Australian law, international legal obligations must be incorporated into Australian domestic law. The Australian Parliament has ensured that serious crimes of international concern, including genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, piracy, slavery and torture (and secondary and inchoate offences relating to these crimes such as attempt, incitement, complicity, aiding and abetting), are comprehensively criminalised under Australian law, and that Australia has the legal capacity to investigate and prosecute those crimes in accordance with the principle of universal jurisdiction. Australia has an established framework for ensuring that perpetrators of serious crimes of international concern are brought to justice. This framework is based on three pillars: border security (i.e. detecting suspected criminals as they enter Australia), domestic investigation and prosecution; and international crime cooperation (including the provision of mutual legal assistance to foreign countries and tribunals and extradition of accused persons). Trials in Australia will generally only be conducted in the presence of the accused. Genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and torture offences The offences of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are prohibited under Division 268 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Commonwealth Criminal Code). Torture is prohibited under Division 274 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. All of these offences are subject to category D jurisdiction, which is defined in section 15.4 as applying whether or not the conduct constituting the alleged offence, or a result of the conduct constituting the alleged offence, occurs in Australia. There is no requirement that the alleged victim or perpetrator be an Australian citizen, resident or body corporate. In order to safeguard against inappropriate prosecutions, the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s consent is required before a prosecution can be commenced for an offence under Division 268 (s 268.121). For an offence under Division 274, the Attorney-General’s consent is required where the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurred wholly outside Australia (s 274.3). In exercising discretion as to whether to consent to a prosecution, the Attorney-General may have regard to matters including considerations of international law, practice and comity, prosecution action that is being, or might be brought, in a foreign country, and other matters of public interest. ... In relation to all of the above offences, the general principles of Australian law relating to individual criminal responsibility apply. ... [Other Statements contain similar information or are Statements made on behalf of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (CANZ) and do not identify specific substantive national law related to the scope and applicability of the principle of universal jurisdiction.] Australia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2017) ... The International Criminal Court Act 2002 (Cth) (ICC Act) establishes mechanisms which allow Australia to assist the International Criminal Court (ICC) in accordance with the Rome Statute. Additionally, the Australian Government has comprehensively criminalized genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Division 268 of the Criminal Code, Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The Criminal Code also criminalizes a range of conduct that interferes with the administration of justice of the ICC. Through this legislation, Australia is able to prosecute any person accused of a Rome Statute crime under Australian law consistent with the principle of complementarity. Other relevant legislation includes the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 (Cth), Crimes (Hostages) Act 1989 (Cth) and War Crimes Act 1945 (Cth). The stand-alone ICC Act establishes mechanisms which allow Australia to assist the ICC in accordance with the Rome Statute. The ICC Act covers matters such as requests for cooperation, for arrest and surrender of persons, investigations or sittings of the ICC in Australia, powers of arrest, information exchange and proceeds of crimes and enforcement of ICC fines and orders. The Australian Government also incorporated the offences of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into Commonwealth criminal law (Division 268 of the Criminal Code). Division 268 of the Criminal Code incorporates the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes against the administration of the justice of the ICC into domestic criminal law.","In terms of investigation of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity offences generally: The Australian Federal Police have responsibility for investigations, as one of their functions pursuant to section 8 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) is to provide police services in relation to the laws of the Commonwealth. Responsibility for investigations currently falls within the Counter Terrorism and Special Investigations Command of the AFP In terms of investigation of the Afghanistan war crimes: The OSI was formally established on 4 January 2021.

Note, however, that the AFP retains investigative responsibility for a small number of cases that were under investigation prior to the establishment of the OSI: see page 43 of Senate Estimates. In relation to the laying of charges for offences of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity (generally and for Afghanistan): This is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP), an independent prosecutorial agency, as one of their functions is to institute prosecutions on indictment for indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth (pursuant to section 6 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth)). Attorney-General’s consent: Proceedings for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity must not be commenced without the Attorney-General’s written consent, however, this  still allows for the person to be arrested, charged, remanded in custody or released on bail before the necessary consent has been given (section 268.121(1) and (3). The Attorney-General’s decision in relation to consent subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court (section 268.22) Private prosecutions: In the case of Taylor v the Attorney-General, the majority of the High Court of Australia interpreted section 268.121(2) to ‘exclude the capacity of  any other person to commence any prosecution of any offence under Div 268’, thereby closing the door on private prosecutions for these offences.

Information on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction Under article 12.3 of the Criminal Code, citizens of the Azerbaijani Republic, foreign nationals or stateless persons who have committed crimes against peace and humanity, war crimes or crimes such as trafficking in persons, terrorism, financing of terrorism, hijacking of an aircraft, hostage-taking, torture, maritime piracy, illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, manufacturing or selling counterfeit currency or securities, attacks on internationally protected persons or organizations, or crimes involving radioactive materials, as well as other crimes whose punishability derives from international agreements to which the Azerbaijani Republic is party, are subject to criminal prosecution and punishment under the current Code, regardless of where the crime was committed. Article 13.3 of the Criminal Code states that if persons who have committed a crime outside the Azerbaijani Republic are not handed over to a foreign State and if the offence (of commission or omission) is deemed a crime under the present Code, they are subject to criminal prosecution in the Azerbaijani Republic. Article 502 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that: 502.1 The prosecuting authority of the Azerbaijani Republic shall, on the basis of an official request from the competent authority of a foreign State and in accordance with legislation of the Azerbaijani Republic, bring a criminal prosecution against citizens of the Azerbaijani Republic suspected of committing an offence on the territory of the requesting State. 502.2 If the competent authority of a foreign State requests the criminal prosecution of a person for an act that is punishable by law and if that act is the subject of a civil claim filed by the victims of the offence, the claim shall be examined during the proceedings in the event that the victims seek compensation for damages suffered. Under paragraph 3 of the note on article 3 of the Act of the Azerbaijani Republic concerning the extradition of persons who have committed crimes, which indicates that when extradition of a person is refused in cases which come under articles 3.1.1 (if the person in question is a citizen of the Azerbaijani Republic at the time when the issue of his or her extradition is being resolved) or 3.1.2 (if under the law of the requesting foreign State the crime which is the basis for extradition is a capital offence) of the Act, in accordance with the motion of the requesting State the person in question may be criminally prosecuted under the law of the Azerbaijani Republic. With regard to the crimes covered by article 12.3 of the Criminal Code, 88 people have been convicted for trafficking in persons, 5,098 for trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, 17 for terrorism and 37 for manufacturing or selling counterfeit money or securities. Azerbaijan's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) Information submitted by the Azerbaijani Republic on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction Respect for the principle of universal jurisdiction in the Azerbaijani Republic derives from the country’s international legal obligations to combat crime. The Azerbaijani Republic is a party to multilateral international treaties to combat such crimes as terrorism, illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, genocide, destruction of a population, apartheid, slavery, war crimes, hijacking of an aircraft, hostage-taking, crimes against internationally protected persons, piracy, smuggling, counterfeiting of currency or securities or sale of counterfeit currency or securities, environmental pollution, etc. The principle of universal jurisdiction — the authority to bring criminal charges against an individual under the national law of any State, including the Azerbaijani Republic, regardless of the individual’s nationality or the State in which the individual committed the crime — is enshrined in article 12.3 of the Criminal Code of the Azerbaijani Republic. Under article 12.3 of the Criminal Code of the Azerbaijani Republic, citizens of Azerbaijan, foreign nationals and stateless persons who have committed crimes against peace and humanity, war crimes or crimes such as trafficking in persons, terrorism, financing of terrorism, hijacking of an aircraft, hostage-taking, torture, maritime piracy, illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, counterfeiting of currency or securities or sale of counterfeit currency or securities, attacks on internationally protected persons or organizations, crimes involving radioactive materials as well as other crimes whose punishability derives from the international agreements to which the Azerbaijani Republic is party, are subject to criminal prosecution and punishment under the Criminal Code, regardless of where the crime was committed. Article 13.3 of the Criminal Code states that if individuals who have committed a crime outside of the Azerbaijani Republic are not handed over to a foreign State and the offence (of commission or omission) is deemed a crime under the Criminal Code of the Azerbaijani Republic, they are subject to criminal prosecution in the Azerbaijani Republic. Article 502 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Azerbaijani Republic states that: 502.1 The prosecuting authority of the Azerbaijani Republic shall, on the basis of an official request from the competent authority of a foreign State and in accordance with legislation of the Azerbaijani Republic, bring a criminal prosecution against citizens of the Azerbaijani Republic suspected of committing an offence on the territory of the requesting State. 502.2 If the competent authority of a foreign State requests criminal prosecution of a person for an act, and if that act is the subject of a civil claim filed by the victims of the offence, the claim shall be examined during the proceedings if the victims claim compensation for the damage suffered. Under paragraph 3 of the note on article 3 of the Act of the Azerbaijani Republic on extradition, when extradition is refused in cases which come under articles 3.1.1 (if the requested person is a citizen of the Azerbaijani Republic at the time when the issue of his or her extradition is being resolved) or 3.2.1 (if under the law of the requesting foreign State, the crime which is the basis for extradition is a capital offence) of the Act, in accordance with the motion of the requesting State the person in question may be criminally prosecuted under the law of the Azerbaijani Republic. Under article 75.5 of the Criminal Code of the Azerbaijani Republic, the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution does not apply to persons who have committed crimes against peace and humanity, terrorism, financing of terrorism and war crimes covered under the relevant articles of the Special Section of the Criminal Code. The reference in article 75.5 to the non-application of a statute of limitations to the criminal prosecution of persons who have committed crimes against peace and humanity, terrorism, financing of terrorism and war crimes derives from the requirements of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 26 November 1968, to which the Azerbaijani Republic acceded in 1996. Between 1 September 2000, when the new Criminal Code of the Azerbaijani Republic entered into force, and the end of 2009, no one has been convicted of crimes under chapters 16 (“Crimes against the peace and security of humanity”) and 17 (“War crimes”) of the Criminal Code.",N/A,No,"[Official Translation] Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Law No. 787-IQ of 1999; as of 2018) Article 11.

As an exception to that principle, however, the Bahraini Criminal Code recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction in the sense that the Bahraini Criminal Code can extend to crimes committed abroad. • The exception is set forth in article 9 of the Criminal Code, which provides as follows: “The provisions of the present Act shall apply to any foreigner in the State of Bahrain who perpetrated a crime while abroad (...) under the present Act and for whom an extradition request has not been accepted”. By virtue of that provision, when Bahrain detains the perpetrator on its territory, it may prosecute that person under its own law, regardless of where the crime was committed and the nationality of the perpetrator, provided that it has received and rejected an extradition request. • We now turn to international agreements that are applied in that connection. As an independent sovereign State, Bahrain, along with other States, contributes to the formation of rules of international law and commits itself before the international community to implement those rules. Accordingly, it is committed to applying the international norms that were formed by the international community and have become peremptory in nature, even if there is no written record of its having participated in the formation of those norms and if it did not participate in their formulation. • Bahrain is therefore committed to the international provisions that enshrine the principle of universality once it has ratified those provisions and they have become part of its internal law.",N/A,N/A,N/A,No,N/A,Yes,"[Third Party Translation] Bahrain Penal Code (1976) Article 11 In the event of criminal proceedings being instituted with respect to an offence committed abroad, the judge shall take into consideration in passing a sentence the fact of the accused having undergone punishment, even by way of remand.

The possibility of criminal prosecution of persons who have committed such crimes is provided for in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Belarus and the international treaties to which Belarus is a party. Thus, article 6, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code sets out the universal principle of the spatial applicability of criminal law, in accordance with which, for the following offences, the Criminal Code of Belarus is applied independently of the criminal law of the place in which the act was committed: genocide (art. 127 of the Criminal Code); crimes against the security of humankind (art. 128); production, stockpiling or distribution of prohibited instruments of war (art. 129); ecocide (art. 131); use of a weapon of mass destruction (art. 134); violation of the laws and customs of war (art. 135); criminal violations of the norms of international humanitarian law in time of armed conflict (art. 136); inaction or issuance of a criminal order in time of armed conflict (art. 137); human trafficking (art. 181); and other offences committed outside Belarus which are prosecutable on the basis of an international treaty by which Belarus is bound. Persons who have committed the aforementioned crimes are liable under the Belarusian Criminal Code if they have not been convicted in a foreign State of the crime committed and are prosecuted in the Republic of Belarus (art. 6, para. 4, of the Criminal Code). Furthermore, in application of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968, article 85 of the Criminal Code prohibits the release from criminal responsibility, in connection with the expiration of statutory limitations, of persons who have committed these acts. A foreign national or stateless person who has committed crimes outside Belarus and who is on Belarusian territory may be extradited to a foreign State for criminal prosecution or to serve a prison term under an international treaty to which Belarus is a party (art. 7, para. 2, of the Criminal Code). The specific details of extradition of a perpetrator are determined by his or her nationality and the existence of relevant international treaties, such as the Commonwealth of Independent States Conventions on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters of 22 January 1993 and 7 October 2002, as well as a number of bilateral international treaties on legal assistance to which Belarus is a party. In the absence of an international treaty, under article 7, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, a foreign national or stateless person may be extradited to a foreign State on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, in accordance with the procedure set out in section XV of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Belarus exercises extraterritorial jurisdiction, but only with regard to crimes covered by the relevant international treaties to which Belarus is a party. In order for the principle of universal jurisdiction to be established in its legislation, the relevant provisions of the international treaties to which Belarus is a party must be incorporated into Belarus’s legal system, and legislation regulating the procedural conditions for implementation of the principle must be adopted. ...",N/A,No,"[Unofficial Translation] Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus July 9, 1999 No. 275-Z (as amended 2013) Article 5 4.

Legal action, including the investigation, may be initiated only at the request of the federal prosecutor who assesses any charges that may have been brought. There is no channel through which to appeal against that decision. If a charge has been submitted to the federal prosecutor in application of the preceding paragraphs, he must instruct the examining magistrate to investigate that charge unless: The charge is manifestly unfounded; or The facts cited in the charge cannot be deemed to be one of the breaches stipulated in Part II, section I (a), of the Criminal Code; or That charge cannot lead to an admissible public action; or The actual circumstances of the case show that, in the interest of justice being fairly administered and respecting Belgium’s international obligations, that case should be brought either before international courts or before the courts in the place where the acts were committed, or before the courts of the State of which the perpetrator is a national or those of the place where he may be found, provided that those courts demonstrate independence, impartiality and equity, as may arise, in particular, from the relevant international commitments between Belgium and that State. Article 12bis Apart from the cases referred to in Articles 6 to 11, the Belgian courts are also competent to reside over cases concerning breaches committed outside the territory of the Kingdom and stipulated in international treaties, customary law or derived from the law of the European Union, which is binding on Belgium, when that law requires Belgium to submit the matter to its competent authorities to take legal action. Prosecution, including the investigation, may only be initiated by the federal prosecutor who assesses any charges that may have been brought. If a charge has been submitted to the federal prosecutor in application of the preceding paragraphs, he must instruct the investigating judge to investigate that charge unless: 1°The charge is manifestly unfounded; or 2°The facts cited in the charge cannot be deemed to be one of the breaches stipulated in Part II, section I (a), of the Penal Code; or 3°That charge cannot lead to an admissible public action; or 4°The actual circumstances of the case show that, in the interest of a good administration of justice and respecting Belgium’s international obligations, that case should be brought either before international courts or before the courts in the place where the acts were committed, or before the courts of the State of which the perpetrator is a national or those of the place where he may be found, provided that those courts demonstrate independence, impartiality and equity, as may arise, in particular, from the relevant international commitments between Belgium and that State.

At the same time, however, the 2003 act modifies the procedure for applying to Belgian courts by providing that prosecutions, including investigations, can be undertaken only at the request of the federal prosecutor, who assesses the complaints made. The procedure of instituting civil indemnification proceedings is therefore abandoned, with the exception of cases where an offence is perpetrated wholly or partly in Belgium or where the alleged perpetrator of an offence is Belgian or resides primarily in Belgium. ... As mentioned above, application to an examining magistrate by instituting civil indemnification proceedings is no longer possible, with the exception of cases where an offence is perpetrated wholly or partly in Belgium or where the alleged perpetrator of an offence is Belgian or resides primarily in Belgium. When he receives a complaint, the federal prosecutor refers it to the examining magistrate for investigation. Nevertheless, the law provides for several grounds which may justify a decision not to initiate proceedings or a decision on inadmissibility taken either by the indictment division, at the behest of the federal prosecutor (a, b and c), or directly by the federal prosecutor (d).13 This is what happens when one of the following situations obtains: (a) The complaint is manifestly unfounded; (b) The facts cited in the complaint do not correspond to the classification of offences set forth in book II, chapter I bis of the Penal Code concerning grave violations of international humanitarian law; (c) The complaint cannot result in an admissible case; (d) It is apparent from the specific circumstances of the case that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice and in respect for Belgium’s international obligations, this case should be brought either before international courts, or before the court in the place where the acts were committed, or before a court of the State of which the perpetrator is a national or of the place where he can be located, in so far as such court demonstrates the attributes of independence, impartiality and equity which accord, in particular, with the relevant international commitments between Belgium and that State. If the decision not to undertake proceedings or a decision on inadmissibility is made on the basis of one of the last two grounds set forth above (c or d), the decision is communicated to the Minister of Justice, who informs the International Criminal Court thereof if the acts in question were committed after 30 June 2002, when the temporal jurisdiction of this court came into effect. Lastly, the preliminary chapter of the Code of Criminal Procedure contains a provision indicating that the principle ne bis in idem remains applicable in the context of proceedings undertaken on the basis of universal jurisdiction: except in respect of crimes and offences committed during times of war, Belgian courts will not be competent when the accused, after being tried in a foreign country for the same offence, has been acquitted, or when after being convicted his sentence has been served or extinguished, or he has been pardoned or amnestied.","Law containing the preliminary title of the code of criminal procedure of 17 April 1878.

[Original Text] Loi portant code de procédure pénale en République du Bénin (2012) Article 644 : Tout étranger qui, hors du territoire de la République, s'est rendu coupable, soit comme auteur, soit comme complice, d'un crime ou d'un délit attentatoire à la sûreté de l'Etat ou de contrefaçon du sceau de l'Etat, de monnaies nationales ayant cours, peut être poursuivi et jugé d'après les dispositions des lois béninoises s'il est arrêté en République du Bénin ou si le Gouvernement obtient son extradition. Tout étranger arrêté en République du Bénin, qui, hors du territoire de la République, s'est rendu coupable soit comme auteur, soit comme complice d'un crime ou délit puni par la loi nationale peut être poursuivi et jugé en République du Bénin. Les auteurs ou complices d'infractions commises hors du territoire de la République peuvent être poursuivis et jugés par les juridictions béninoises soit lorsque, conformément aux dispositions du code pénal ou d'un autre texte législatif, la loi béninoise est applicable, soit lorsqu'une convention internationale donne compétence aux juridictions béninoises pour connaître de l'infraction.

The Government of Benin has adopted national legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the “Rome” statute establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC). With regard to the implementation of the “Rome” Statute, the government of Benin has incorporated the substantive articles and provisions of the Statute within pre-existing legislation, and specifically within the Code of Criminal Procedure (CPP) and the Penal Code (CP). The main substantive crimes under the “Rome” statute were incorporated into our national law by Law No 2018-16 of 04 June 2018 on the Penal Code in the Republic of Benin (Articles 456 to 465 of the Penal Code). National positive law through our Code of Criminal Procedure sets out the cooperation arrangements with the International Criminal Court (ICC): a) Arrest and surrender (Articles 774 to 778 of the CPP); b) Interim release and release (Articles 779 to 781 of the CPP); c) Cooperation with the Office of the Prosecutor (Articles 772 to 773 of the CPP); d) Cooperation with the Court regarding the identification, freezing and seizure of proceeds, property and assets and instrumentalities of crimes (Articles 785 to 786 of the CPP); e) Enforcement of sentences (Articles 787 to 789 of the CPP); f) Witness protection; g) Other forms of cooperation (Articles 776 to 777 of the CPP). The implementing legislation provides for the Direction des Affaires Civiles Pénales et des Grâces (DACPG – Directorate of Criminal Civil Cases and Pardons) within the Ministry of Justice and Legislation to be the national central authority for cooperation with the Court. (Article 1 of Decree No 109/MJL/DC/SGM/DACPG/SA 022SGG16 of 15 November 2016) The implementing legislation made no specific provision for the application of privileges and immunities as provided for under the “Rome” statute. But under the monistic clause of Benin’s constitution, simply ratifying the “Rome” statute might enable the direct application of provisions pertaining to said privileges and immunities under Benin’s national law. After the Code of Criminal Procedure took into account the rules of procedure and form laid down by the “Rome” statute in March 2013, it was not until June 2018, over five (05) years later in other words, that the crimes and offences provided for by the statute were internalised. This is proof not only of the clear challenges faced but also of the government’s desire to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of the statute. All types of assistance are desirable to refine the implementation process which is underway. Following the integration of certain provisions of the “Rome” statute in the Code of Criminal Procedure and also in the Penal Code, the government has not as yet begun new procedures to internalize the other provisions of the Statute.","Initially, the Prosecutor (Article 1 of the criminal procedure code) and the victim that suffered from the crime commission (article 90 of the CPC).

The Bolivian State has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, within the meaning of its 128 articles, through Law N° 2398 of 23 March 2002. This Law provides, in its only article, that “in accordance with the powers conferred under article 59 (12) of the Political Constitution of the State, the signature dated 17 July 1998 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, within the meaning of its 128 articles, is adopted and ratified under the law of the Republic”. However, the Statute has not been fully implemented in the Bolivian legal order. Three broad approaches prevail in comparative law for the implementation of the Rome Statute: a) incorporation by reference, by way of an implementing Statute, which provides for direct implementation of the provisions of the Statute by the State judiciary; b) adoption through specific legislation incorporating the provisions of the Rome Statute, separate from applicable criminal and procedural law; and c) systematic incorporation into domestic law, whereby the contents of the Rome Statute are incorporated into applicable criminal and procedural law. In this respect, initially, in 2006, the Bolivian State tried the second approach and drafted a specific law on implementation of the Statute in Bolivian law; however, it did not pass in Congress at the time. Currently, and owing to the adoption of the Political Constitution of the State of 2009, the third approach is being tried, as the Bolivian State is in the process of adopting new codes in the legislative areas set out in above Constitution. To date, the following codes have been adopted: the Code of Civil Procedure, through Law N° 439; the Child and Adolescent Code, through Law N° 548; and the Code of Family Law and Procedure, through Law N° 603. The Criminal Code is being prepared since 2014 as part of this new process of codification; it will involve a full reform of both substantive and procedural criminal law. The preliminary draft is being prepared by an Inter-institutional Committee composed of the Vice presidency of the Plurinational State, both chambers of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, the Ministry of Justice and the State Attorney General. The criminal offences of the new code are currently being drafted and adapted. This full revision will incorporate both the substantive and procedural contents of the Rome Statute. With regard to the substantive part, under Chapter One, Title II of Book I, the preliminary draft covers crimes against humanity and other crimes which are adapted to the provisions of the Rome Statute and which the Inter-institutional Committee is currently working on. In addition, Book II of the preliminary draft on procedure provides for international cooperation mechanisms, including cooperation with the International Criminal Court. According to the schedule of the Inter-institutional Committee, the preliminary draft should be ready by the end of December of this year and will be formally submitted to the Plurinational Legislative Assembly by the end of December or beginning of January 2016 as a draft law. In our State, the Rome Statute is being implemented through systematic incorporation of the provisions of the Statute into domestic law, as provided in the preliminary draft of the criminal code. ... Bolivia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2011) ... The Bolivian State has incorporated into its domestic legislation mechanisms for support and coordination with the institutions of the State which deal specifically with the Rome Statute: -Law N°260 of 12 July 2012, the Organic Law of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, stipulates that one of the latter’s functions is to provide the international judicial, administrative or investigative cooperation envisaged in current international laws, treaties and conventions. -Likewise, article 138 of the Criminal Code (as amended by Law N°1768 of 18 March 1997), defines the crime of Genocide in the following terms: “Any person who, with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical or religious group, kills or causes harm to members of the group, inflicts upon it inhumane conditions of survival, imposes upon it measures intended to prevent its reproduction, or forcibly transfers children of the group to adults or to other groups shall be punishable by a prison sentence of ten to twenty years (...)” ... Bolivia's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) I. Application of the principle of universal jurisdiction in Bolivia The principle of universal jurisdiction is not enshrined in Bolivian law; there is a tendency to observe the principle of territorial jurisdiction, while leaving open the possibility of applying the former principle in accordance with international treaties or agreements ratified by the State. In this connection, article 1 of the current Penal Code states as follows: ""This Code shall apply to: 1. Crimes committed in the territory of Bolivia or in localities under its jurisdiction; 2. Crimes committed abroad which have produced or were intended to produce results in Bolivian territory or in localities under its jurisdiction; 3. Crimes committed abroad by a Bolivian, provided that he or she is in the national territory and has not been punished in the locality where the crime was committed; 4. Crimes committed abroad against State security, public confidence and the national economy. This provision extends to aliens if they have been extradited or are found in Bolivian territory; 5. Crimes committed on board Bolivian vessels, aircraft or other means of transportation in a foreign country, if they have not been prosecuted in that country; 6. Crimes committed abroad by Bolivian civil servants in the performance of their duties; 7. Crimes that Bolivia is required by treaty or convention to punish, even if they were not committed in its territory."" II. Applicable international treaties and instruments As indicated above, application of the principle of universal jurisdiction in Bolivia is subject to the international treaties or agreements ratified by the State. International human rights instruments have constitutional status as established by the Political State Constitution in its article 410.II: ""the international human rights treaties and agreements and norms of regional law ratified by the country have constitutional rank"". Similarly, article 256 of the current constitutional text states as follows: ""I. International human rights treaties and instruments which have been signed, ratified or acceded to by the State and contain rights more favourable than those contained in the Constitution shall be applied in preference to the latter. II. The rights recognized in the Constitution shall be interpreted in accordance with international human rights treaties when the latter provide more favourable provisions."" In this connection, it may be noted that the principle of universal jurisdiction is implicit in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which was ratified by the Bolivian State through Act No. 1930 of 10 February of 1999, the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, ratified through Act No. 2116 of 11 September 2000, the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, ratified through Act No. 2116 of 11 September 2000 and the InterAmerican Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons, ratified through Act No. 1695 of 5 May 1999. It is important to note that the international instruments referred to do not explicitly refer to the principle of universal jurisdiction, but the principle may be inferred in cases of systematic and widespread practice of torture, forced disappearance of persons, genocide or apartheid. Furthermore, recognition of the principle of universal jurisdiction is particularly important in the practice of international humanitarian law, as the Geneva Conventions refer to the obligation of States to search for accused individuals, whatever their nationality, and bring them before their own courts or hand them over to another party for trial.1 The Bolivian State has ratified the main international humanitarian law conventions, as follows: 1. Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field and the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1929) - ratified through an Act of 14 August 1935. 2. Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field (1949) – ratified initially by Supreme Decree No. 13531, of 29 April 1976, and subsequently by Act No. 1151 of 14 May 1990. 3. Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea (1949) – ratified initially by Supreme Decree No. 13531, of 29 April 1976, and subsequently by Act No. 1151 of 14 May 1990. 4. Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949) – ratified initially by Supreme Decree No. 13531, of 29 April 1976, and subsequently by Act No. 1151 of 14 May 1990. 5. Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1949) – ratified initially by Supreme Decree No. 13531, of 29 April 1976, and subsequently by Act No. 1151 of 14 May 1990.2 Nevertheless, as international humanitarian law applies in situations of external war or internal armed conflicts, this principle has not been applied in the Bolivian courts. Lastly, attention is drawn to the relationship of the principle of universal jurisdiction with the establishment of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which was ratified by the Plurinational State of Bolivia through Act No. 2398 of 24 May 2002. The Court “shall have the power to exercise its jurisdiction over persons for the most serious crimes of international concern”. As for its implementation in domestic law, article 111 of the Political State Constitution establishes that statutory limitations do not apply to genocide, crimes against humanity, treason or war crimes. The Bolivian State has prepared a draft law on implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, No. 920/2008, which was submitted by the Office of the Public Ombudsman in 2008. Its article 5 recognizes universal jurisdiction for crimes specified under international law: genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes against international humanitarian law, as follows: “Art. 5 (Jurisdictional bases) This Act shall apply (…) to genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of international humanitarian law as described in this Act, even if they were not committed in Bolivian territory or by Bolivians and did not affect Bolivian citizens or national interests or have any other relation to the Bolivian State except in so far as they are offences that affect the international community as a whole.” Furthermore, a proposal made by the Ministry of Justice for a comprehensive reform of the Penal Code is currently under consideration. It includes a specific chapter on crimes against international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.",Public Prosecutors,No,"[Unofficial Translation] Presidential Decree No. 2437 on pardon and amnesty Article 3 (Exclusions for the Granting of Amnesty).

With respect to the aforesaid, Article 9 of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina stipulates the following: ""(1) The criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall apply to anyone who, outside of its territory, perpetrates: (a) Any criminal offence against the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina prescribed in Chapter Sixteen of this Code (Criminal Offences against the Integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina); (b) The criminal offence of Counterfeiting Money or of Counterfeiting Securities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the criminal offence of Counterfeiting Instruments of Value or of Forgery of Trademarks, Measures and Weights issued on the basis of regulations of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as defined in Articles 205 through 208 of this Code; (c) A criminal offence which Bosnia and Herzegovina is bound to punish according to the provisions of international law and international treaties or intergovernmental agreements; (d) A criminal offence against an official or responsible person in the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in relation to his office. (2) The criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall apply to a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina who, outside the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, perpetrates any criminal offence. (3) The criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall apply to an alien who, outside the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, perpetrates a criminal offence not included in paragraph 1 of this Article against Bosnia and Herzegovina or its national. (4) The criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall apply to an alien : who, outside the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, perpetrates a criminal offence against a foreign state or a foreign national which under this legislation carries a punishment of imprisonment for a term of five years or a more severe punishment. (5) In the cases referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall apply only if the perpetrator of the criminal offence is found in or extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina, while in the case referred ; to in paragraph 4 of this Article, only if the perpetrator is found In the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is not extradited to another country."" Such a wording of Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the aforementioned Article expresses international solidarity in crime prevention. In fact, It may be asserted that all states have interest in preventing international criminal offenses irrespective of where those offenses were committed or by and against whom they were perpetrated. However, it would be unjustifiable if each state would provide for the application of its own law every time an alien commits a criminal offense abroad against a foreign state or a foreign national. That could have collision of criminal legislations of respective states · as its adverse result, which would further lead to a disruption of political relations between these states, due to which all the underlying aspirations of the universal principle would tum into its opposite. For that very reason, it is necessary that every state requests additional conditions for the application of its own law. The most important condition in that respect is the presence of a perpetrator of an offense in the territory of the state which applies its law pursuant to the universal principle {forum deprehensionis). Such a condition is prescribed by Article 9, Paragraph 5 of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which provides that the criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be applied only if an alien is found in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Is not extradited to a foreign state. Therefore, pursuant to the universal principle, the laws of our state shall be applied when no other state requests the extradition of the respective alien. or when such extradition is refused. In practice, extradition is usually carried out if all the conditions have bee11 met for its execution, whereby it might be concluded that such a fact, together with numerous conditions for the application of universal principle, virtually diminishes the significance of this principle. That is not the case, however, as it is this very principle that allows for a criminal sanction to be applied on a perpetrator of a criminal offense at all times. Namely, there Is both the need for, and the justification of, the application of domestic Jaw. especially in a case when a foreign state's request for extradition has been refused. This may be viewed even as an obligation of a state that has refused the extradition, which is explicitly provided for in some international treaties (the principle of aut dedere aut judiciareJ. The obligation on a state to conduct a trial against an alien when a foreign state's request for extradition has been refused would not be possible to implement without the universal principle which allows for the application of domestic law in such cases. Due to the inexistence of a direct link between the state which undertakes prosecution and the perpetrated criminal offense, the principle of universal jurisdiction in international criminal law is necessarily limited to serious criminal offenses, or protection of important objects, which are of interest to all the states. In this respect) and in accordance with Article 9 of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the application of the domestic legislation on a foreign national requires that the relevant offense is also punishable by the legislation of the state in which the crime was committed, and that such an offense carries a punishment of imprisonment for a term of five years or a more severe punishment under the laws of the respective state.","Public Prosecutors [Official Translation] Law on Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and Cooperation with the International Criminal Court (2009) Article 9 (Jurisdiction to Act) (1) The BiH Prosecutor’s Office and the Court of BiH have jurisdiction to conduct the criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of criminal offences under Article 1 of this Law. ...

Applicable International Treaties 2.1 Internationally, Botswana has ratified several treaties containing the principle of universal jurisdiction. However, few of these have been domesticated to give them effect in Botswana's national legislation. Botswana has a dual legal system that requires that all Treaties that have been ratified by the country be domesticated first and incorporated into national legislation. Therefore, any international Treaty that Botswana is party to and provides for universal jurisdiction will not be recognised by the Courts of Botswana nor have legal effect within Botswana if it has not been made into law by an Act of Parliament. 2.2 There are several circumstances that make the domestication of Treaties a slow process. Botswana is aware of the principle of international law that a country cannot use on lack of domestic legislation as an excuse for non compliance with her treaty obligations. A number of issues such as lack of capacity in implementing the obligations of treaties so signed and inadequate resources are some of the obstacles in domesticating a majority of treaties. 2.3 That notwithstanding, Botswana is a party to the following international treaties which extend universal jurisdiction to those countries that have also signed these conventions: • The Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on International Humanitarian Law; • Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; Adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1984; • Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Adopted by the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court on 17 July 1998; • GAD Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; Adopted at Algiers by the 35th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government in July 1999; • International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; Adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1999; • International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; Adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 15 December 1997; and • United Nations Convention on the law of the Sea. 3. Universal Jurisdiction in Botswana - Legal rules and Judicial practice 3.1 Domestically, Botswana has enacted the Geneva Conventions Act [Cap 39:03] to enable Botswana to give effect to certain international conventions made at Geneva defining the basic rights of those captured during military conflict protection of those wounded during war, protection of the civilian population in and around the war zone. The Act provides at Section 3 that 'any person, whatever his nationality, who whether in or outside Botswana, commits.....any such grave breach of any of the scheduled. conventions...shall be guilty of an offence."" It further states that where an offence under Section 3 is committed outside Botswana, the person may be proceeded against, indicted, tried and punished in any place in Botswana as if the offence so committed was committed within the jurisdiction of Botswana. 3.1 The crimes so scheduled as provided in Section 3 are diverse and include willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment, biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body and health, compelling a prisoner of war to serve in the forces of the hostile power willfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial, taking hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property. 3.2 Any Magistrate within Botswana will have jurisdiction to hear the cases invoking me Geneva Conventions Act only if the Director of Public Prosecutions has instituted the proceedings. Where there is doubt in relation to the circumstances in which the Act applies, evidence must be obtained from the President of the Republic in the form of a certificate setting out such requisite determination. Such certificate must be signed by or on behalf of the President and shall be accepted as evidence in proving the said circumstances. 3.3 Even though Botswana has domesticated the Geneva Conventions, their application has never been tested in the domestic courts of Botswana. Currently therefore, there is no judicial practice nor is there any judicial precedent on the application thereof which Botswana can report on to the Secretary General. 3.4 The obstacles to the implementation of the Geneva Conventions Act have been identified as the lack of expertise and manpower in Botswana to indict, try and prosecute the crimes under the Act and the expenses connected with the implementation of the Act in so far as prosecuting offenders not present within our borders. In addition, gathering evidence for the crimes so committed is a difficult and time consuming process which can put an enormous strain on the resources of a country. Botswana's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2011) ... Botswana ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (the Statute) on the 8th September 2000. Botswana is a Roman/ Dutch and Common Law jurisdiction and therefore a ""dualist"" state. As such, the national courts cannot apply international law as a direct source of law. Botswana must incorporate its treaty obligations through an Act of Parliament for them to become part of the national laws and it is in this context that she is in the process of drafting an ICC Bill to domesticate the Rome Statute into national law. ...","Public Prosecutors [Original Text] Geneva Conventions Act (1970) 3.

In the Bulgarian criminal legislation, the Principle of Universal Jurisdiction is governed by art. 6[1] of the Criminal Code. Its essence is that the Bulgarian law will be applied when the crime is committed abroad from a foreign citizen and that the crime affects the interest of a foreign country or individual and any of the following preconditions are met: - the act constitutes any of the crimes under Chapter XIV ""Crimes against peace and humanity"" in the Special part of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Bulgaria. - Bulgaria has an obligation under international law to initiate criminal proceedings for certain crimes. Among the international treaties to which Republic of Bulgaria is a party, there are none that directly invoke the Principle of Universal Jurisdiction. At the same time, the principle ""aut dedere aut iuducare"" (""either extradite or prosecute"") is enshrined in a number of multilateral international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions, The UN Convention against Corruption, The UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to which the Republic of Bulgaria is a party. According to some concepts in international law, the principle of ""aut dedere aut iuducare"" implies the existence of universal jurisdiction. [1] Art. 6. (1) The Criminal Code shall also apply to aliens who have committed a crime against peace and humanity abroad, which affects the interests of another state or foreign nationals. (2) The Criminal Code shall also apply to other crimes committed by foreigners abroad where provided for in an international agreement to which the Republic of Bulgaria is a party. Bulgaria's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2017) ... A number of provisions have been adopted with the effect of implementing the Rome Statute. In order to maintain consistency and a consolidated source of criminal law, the relevant provisions of the Statute have been incorporated into pre-existing law. The Bulgarian Criminal Code does not make reference to the Statute, but it incorporates the substantive crimes into domestic law (Chapter 14: Crimes against Peace and Humanity (Articles 407-419a). ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... The territorial scope of the Penal Code of the Republic of Bulgaria is defined by several basic principles. The first of these principles is the so-called territorial principle, according to which the territorial borders of the State also define the territorial scope of the penal law. This means that the Penal Code applies to all criminal offences committed within the territory of the Bulgarian State, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a Bulgarian national or a foreign national (Article 3 ( 1) of the Penal Code). Article 4 of the Penal Code also provides for the personal principle of application of the Bulgarian Penal Code, according to which the Penal Code furthermore applies to Bulgarian nationals with regard to the criminal offences they have committed abroad. The Penal Code also applies to aliens who have committed criminal offences abroad, but only when the offences they have committed are indictable and affect the interests of the Bulgarian State or of Bulgarian nationals (Article 5 of the Penal Code). The universal principle of application of the norms of penal law is regulated by Article 6 of the Penal Code. The provision is mandatory in nature and unambiguously identifies the prerequisites required for the establishment of criminal jurisdiction. According to Article 6(1), the penal law applies to aliens who have committed abroad crimes against peace and humanity, including crimes against the laws and customs of war, genocide and apartheid, thereby affecting the interests of another State or of foreign nationals. Article 6 (2) provides that the Penal Code furthermore applies to other offences committed by aliens abroad, where it so provided for in an international agreement to which the Republic of Bulgaria is a party. Therefore, when the Republic of Bulgaria is a party to an international agreement which contains a provision on the establishment of universal jurisdiction with regard to the offences specified by the international instrument, the Bulgarian Penal Code makes it possible to undertake effective criminal prosecution of the perpetrator of such kind of offence, regardless of the territory within which this offence was committed and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim, as well as without requiring a link between the offence as committed and the State which claims jurisdiction in this particular case. Considering the above, it should be noted that the Republic of Bulgaria can exercise its universal criminal jurisdiction to an equal degree with regard to the above-mentioned offences governed by customary international law: genocide, crimes against humanity, grave violations of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or other violations of international humanitarian law committed in international or non-international armed conflict, as well as with regard to crimes defined by international treaties to which Bulgaria is a party (such as torture, unlawful seizure of aircraft, taking of hostages, terrorism). The Republic of Bulgaria is party to the following international instruments relevant to the issues discussed above and which, at the same time, define crimes falling under the scope of Article 6(1) and (2) of the Penal Code: • Article 6 (I) of the Penal Code - Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 1998 (signed on 11 February 1999 and ratified by a law adopted by the National Assembly on 15 March 2002, promulgated in the State Gazette No. 31 of 26 March 2002). •Article 6 (2) of the Penal Code - Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984 (ratified by State Council Decree No. 3384 of 9 October 1986, promulgated in the Stale Gazelle No. 42 of 3 June 1988, amended in State Gazette No. 19 of 24 February 1995); - Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft of 1970 (ratified by National Assembly Presidium Decree No. 564 of 1 April 1971, promulgated in the State Gazette No. 29 of 13 April 1971. The Convention entered into force for Bulgaria on 14 October 1971 and was promulgated in the State Gazette No. 12 of 11 February 1972); - Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft of 1963 (ratified by State Council Decree No. 1470 of 27 July 1989, promulgated in the State Gazette No. 60 of 4 August 1989); - International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages of 1979 (ratified by State Council Decree No. 3418 of 16 December 1987, promulgated in the State Gazette No. 98 of 1987. The Convention entered into force for Bulgaria on 9 April 1988 and was promulgated in the State Gazelle No. 41 of 31 May 1988); - International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings of 1997 (ratified by a law adopted by the National Assembly on 13 November 2001, promulgated in the State Gazelle No. 102 of 27 November 2001. The Convention was promulgated in the State Gazette No. 36 of 9 April 2002); - International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism of 1999 (ratified by a law adopted by the National Assembly on 23 January 2002, promulgated in the State Gazette No. 11 of 2002. The Convention entered into force for Bulgaria on 15 May 2002 and was promulgated in the State Gazette No. 70 of 19 July 2002). ... Bulgaria's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2009) ... Bulgarian Government adopted the relevant legislation measures by which the Rome Statute was implemented in the Bulgarian legislation. The Republic of Bulgaria signed the Statute on 11 February 1999 and ratified it by law, adopted by the 39th National Assembly on 15 March 2002 (promulgated in State Gazette, No. 31/26.03.2002). Bulgaria deposited its instrument of ratification of the Rome Statute on 11 April 2002. With the ratification act Bulgaria took place among the first sixty states that contributed to the entering into force of the Rome Statute only four years after its adoption. PART B 5. In implementing the Statute, did your Government draft special implementing legislation or did it incorporate the articles or substantive provisions of the Statute into pre-existing law? While implementing the Statute, the Bulgarian Government did not draft special implementing law because some substantive provisions have already existed in the national legislation in particular in the Penal Code of the Republic of Bulgaria since its adoption in 1968. Such an example is Chapter XIV,,Crimes against peace and humanity"" which includes substantial provisions defining crimes like genocide and apartheid, crimes against peace, crimes against the laws and customs of waging war (for details s. Annex 1). In view of the abovementioned we can summarize that when implementing the Rome Statute, the Bulgarian authorities have followed the second approach by incorporating the articles or substantive provisions of the Statute into pre-existing law.","[Third Party Translation] Criminal Code of the Republic of Bulgaria of 01 May 1968 Art. 23 - obligation for instituting penal procedure (1) Where the conditions provided for by this Code are present, the competent state body shall be obligated to institute penal proceedings.

Cameroon, which is particularly attentive to the behavior of its nationals and to the crimes that this principle wishes to punish, has included in its Criminal Code and its Code of criminal procedure provisions which give jurisdiction to Cameroonian courts to hear matters related to offenses committed by its nationals, regardless of where they were committed. To be more complete, my country maintains a fruitful judicial cooperation in this regard. Cameroon's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... II. International treaties that contain provisions pertaining to the principle Cameroon is party to a number of conventions that contain express provisions relating to the mechanism of universal jurisdiction. Under these conventions, a State party has an obligation to punish or to extradite any individual suspected of having committed the offences referred to in those conventions who is present in its territory. These conventions are the Geneva Conventions of 1949 concerning the protection of war victims, the two additional protocols thereto, dated 1977, concerning serious violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes, and also the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 10 December 1984, which Cameroon ratified on 19 December 1986. III. Rules of domestic law There is, strictly speaking, no specific law on universal jurisdiction in Cameroon. Nonetheless, there are provisions in the Penal Code (sections 8, 10, 11 and 132 bis (e)) and the Criminal Procedure Code (sections 642 and 699) which confer on Cameroon jurisdiction over certain offences, irrespective of the nationality of perpetrator or victim or where the offences were committed. These provisions are as follows: Penal Code Section 8: “The criminal law of the Republic shall apply to: (a) Any offence of which one ingredient was committed in its territory; (b) Offences against State security, forgery of the State seal or counterfeiting of national currencies that are legal tender in the country, even when committed abroad. However, no foreign national may be judged by the jurisdictions of the Republic in application of subsection (b) unless the foreign national was arrested in the territory of the Republic or was extradited thereto”. Section 10: “(1) The criminal law of the Republic shall apply to acts committed abroad by a citizen or a resident, provided that they are punishable under the legislation of the place where they were committed and that they are defined as crimes or other offences under the law of the Republic. However, the punishment shall not be greater than that prescribed by the foreign law. (2) However, no citizen or resident accused of having committed an offence against an individual may be tried in a Cameroonian court pursuant to the present section, unless the Public Prosecutor’s Office is acting upon a complaint or official charge submitted to the Government of the Republic by the Government of the country in which the act was committed”. Section 11: “The criminal law of the Republic shall apply to piracy, human trafficking, slave trade or drug trafficking, even when committed outside the territory of the Republic. However, no foreign national may be tried in the territory of the Republic for offences referred to in the present section, committed abroad, unless the foreign national was arrested in the territory of the Republic and was not extradited and provided that the prosecution is undertaken by the Public Prosecutor’s Office”. Section 132 bis (e) respecting the offence of torture: “The conditions set forth in section 10, subsection 1 of the present code shall not be applicable to torture”. This is the principle of double jeopardy. Criminal Procedure Code Section 642: “(1) Any act serving as a ground for extradition shall: (a) by the laws of the requesting State and of Cameroon, either constitute an offence punishable with a minimum sentence of loss of liberty of not less than two (2) years for which prosecution is not barred by prescription, amnesty or otherwise; or consist of a term of loss of liberty which is still legally enforceable within six (6) months at least notwithstanding imprisonment in default of payment; (b) by Cameroon law, constitute an ordinary law offence; (c) from the circumstance show that extradition is not requested for political, religious or racial reasons, or based on the nationality of the person concerned. (2) (a) Felonies and misdemeanours which are not directed against any kind of government shall be considered as common law offences and may justify extradition. (b) Offences of universal jurisdiction provided by international conventions and ratified by Cameroon shall be considered as ordinary law offences. Section 699: “An offence shall be considered as having been committed in Cameroon: (a) where one of the ingredients of the offence was committed in the Republic of Cameroon; (b) where it is an offence of fraudulently changing the seal of the Republic of Cameroon or any counterfeiting of currency being legal tender in Cameroon; (c) where it is an offence against the law relating to narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors; (d) where it is an offence against the law relating to toxic wastes; (e) where it is an offence against the law relating to terrorism; (f) where it is an offence against the law relating to money laundering”. From the foregoing, it can be concluded that Cameroon law provides for the prosecution of foreign nationals.

Canada has incorporated the principle of universal jurisdiction into domestic legislation by allowing Canadian courts to prosecute certain crimes that did not take place in Canada. The Government of Canada takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that Canada is not a safe haven for perpetrators of serious international crimes. In 2000, Canada enacted the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act (CAHWCA)1 to implement into Canadian law violations of international criminal law and international humanitarian law that are subject to individual criminal responsibility in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (the Rome Statute). 2 The CAHWCA extends criminal liability in a manner consistent with the Rome Statute and at times goes beyond it, including within its ambit war crimes arising out of customary international humanitarian law and international criminal law. As a result, the CAHWCA is structured to accommodate new developments in international criminal law, whether originating from the International Criminal Court or other international law sources. The Criminal Code of Canada also extends criminal liability under universal jurisdiction for certain offences, for the most part when linked to the presence of the person in Canada after the commission of the alleged offence. The cases of Munyaneza3 and Mungwarere4 , are two examples in which Canadian domestic courts prosecuted individuals in Canada for crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994. ... Presence in Canada: Canada generally conditions its universal jurisdiction on presence of the perpetrator in Canada after the commission of the alleged offence. Due to limited resources and investigative challenges, Canadian officials will not open an investigation where the alleged perpetrator is not present in the country or where he or she has not been identified. The definition of “present in Canada” has not been litigated, but in practice, it is defined as longer than a fleeting visit. Should an alleged perpetrator depart Canada during an investigation, Canadian officials assess whether it is permanent or temporary. If the individual is determined to have permanently left Canada, officials then consider whether or not to continue with the criminal investigation. It may be, in such instances, that a different type of remedy implicating immigration status is preferred. Decision to initiate an investigation: Once a partner in Canada’s War Crimes Program receives a criminal allegation pursuant to the CAHWCA, a preliminary assessment of the allegation is submitted to the File Review Committee (FRC) that is composed of the Department of Justice, Canadian Border Services Agency, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The FRC decides how to proceed with the allegation, (i.e., no action, commence a criminal investigation, commence immigration proceedings). The criteria deliberated are: the level of personal involvement of the suspect, the type of crime, and the likelihood of success. In practice, authorities consider the alleged perpetrator’s presence in Canada, as noted above; whether they have the ability to conduct investigations; and what type of crimes are alleged. To assess their ability to conduct investigations, authorities take into consideration access to the evidence, the availability of the evidence, access to the country where the crime was committed, and the possibility of cooperation with that country. Prosecutorial Discretion: All crimes in Canada are subject to prosecutorial discretion. The Public Prosecution Service of Canada Deskbook (PPSC Deskbook) contains guidelines to assist prosecutors in deciding whether to proceed with a prosecution for crimes pursuant to the Criminal Code and pursuant to the CAHWCA.5 The PPSC Deskbook articulates two fundamental principles that guide decisions on whether or not to prosecute: the existence of a reasonable prospect of conviction and public interest. The “reasonable prospect of conviction” test requires that there be more than a prima facie case, but does not require a probability of conviction. The assessment takes into account the availability and credibility of witnesses, admissibility of evidence and possible defences. The consideration of possible defences includes potential immunities or amnesties that may apply. The public interest criterion is informed by the gravity of the alleged offence; the accused person’s circumstances, including age and background; the accused’s alleged degree of culpability; the prosecution’s likely effect on the public’s confidence in the administration of justice; the need for specific or general deterrence; the entitlement of other persons to reparations if the prosecution proceeds; whether the prosecution would necessarily entail the disclosure of sensitive or confidential information; and the degree of public concern surrounding the alleged offence. In addition, for universal jurisdiction cases, the international context of the case will be considered. The decision to prosecute is assessed on an on-going basis throughout the case. For instance, if key evidence becomes no longer available, the viability to continue will be reassessed. A decision not to prosecute can be challenged by way of judicial review. Double jeopardy If a person was previously tried in another State for the same act, he or she can plead autrefois acquit, autrefois convict or pardon and the person is deemed to have been so tried and dealt with in Canada. The person will not be deemed to have been so tried and dealt with under the CAHWCA, if it is found that the court proceedings in that foreign State “(a) were for the purpose of shielding the person from criminal responsibility; or (b) were not otherwise conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due process recognized by international law, and were conducted in a manner that, in the circumstances, was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person to justice.” Consent of the Attorney General of Canada: The CAHWCA, the Criminal Code and the Geneva Conventions Act include provisions for the consent of the Attorney General of Canada or the Deputy Attorney General of Canada for universal jurisdiction offences in an effort to permit foreign policy, concurrent claims of jurisdiction and other implications to be considered. Therefore, it is not possible for private actors to lay charges. ...

A person who is charged with or found guilty of the same offence cannot be considered a victim."" According to Section 19(2) CVBR, the victim needs to be present in Canada or be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident in Canada in order to be considered a victim. In addition, section 3 of the CBVR states that the following individuals are entitled to exercise a victim’s rights when the victim is dead or incapable of acting on his or her own behalf: - the victim's spouse or co-habiting partner; - a relative or dependant of the victim and - anyone who has custody of the victim, or is responsible for the care or support of the victim's dependant.

However, the case law suggests that this does not include pre-trial procedures such as investigation and arrest. This is confirmed by practitioners who point to the independence of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in matters relating to investigations. Similarly for torture under Section 269.1 of the Criminal Code, Section 7(7) of the Criminal Code requires the consent of the Attorney General within eight days after the proceedings are commenced. The Attorney General’s refusal to consent to proceedings, which is equivalent to a decision not to prosecute, can be challenged via judicial review.

Section 9(1) of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act allows for “proceedings for an offence under this Act alleged to have been committed outside Canada […], whether or not the person is in Canada, be commenced”. There is no definition of the term “proceedings” in the CAHWCA. In practice, it is read as meaning the initiation of a prosecution when charges are laid.

The War Crimes Program engages four state entities: the Canadian Border Services Agency; Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; and the Department of Justice. Each of these entities has specialized units and/or roles that contribute to the investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes. 1. Immigration Services The Canada Border Services Agency and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada collaborate to screen individuals seeking entry to Canada who are suspected of having committed or been complicit in the perpetration of serious international crimes. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada can also submit citizenship revocation referrals to the Department of Justice for Canadian citizens suspected of having committed or been complicit in the perpetration of serious international crimes. 2. Royal Canadian Mounted Police The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has a Sensitive and International Investigations Unit, which conducts investigations into alleged perpetrators of serious international crimes in collaboration with the other entities belonging to the War Crimes Program. Within the Sensitive and International Investigations Unit, the Extra-Territorial Response Unit is responsible for collecting evidence against individuals suspected of having committed or been complicit in the perpetration of serious international crimes. Along with Department of Justice’s War Crimes Section, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is responsible for determining whether to recommend cases of alleged serious international crimes for prosecution to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. 3. Canadian Department of Justice The Canadian Department of Justice hosts the War Crimes Section, a team of lawyers and other specialists which provides legal advice and support to the other entities belonging to the War Crimes Program. The War Crimes Section seconds lawyers and other specialists to assist the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with its investigations into individuals suspected of having committed or been complicit in the perpetration of serious international crimes. In coordination with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the War Crimes Section is further responsible for deciding whether to recommend that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada pursue a criminal case in response to such investigations, and it provides factual information, legal analysis, and personnel to support the Service’s prosecution teams. The War Crime Section crafts recommendations in relation to serious international crimes cases for the Attorney General of Canada, who must give their consent before charges can be filed in such cases. It also work with international institutions, including international tribunals and special courts.

By Law 20.352 of 30 May 2009, our country implemented a constitutional reform authorizing the Chilean State to recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court under the terms provided for in the Rome Statute. The Constitutional Court of Chile found that a constitutional reform was required in order for our country to ratify the treaty. Accordingly, on 18 July 2009, Law 20.357 defining crimes against humanity and genocide as well as war crimes was published. Above law was intended to align Chilean legislation by defining any conduct constituting a crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court prior to ratifying the said treaty. This was mainly due to the fact that it was considered appropriate for Chile to have the necessary rules and regulations in place to comply with the principle of complementarity set out in the Statute. 3. The Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court was ratified on 26 September 2011. 4. The amendments to article 8 of the Rome Statute and the amendments concerning the crime of aggression of the Rome Statute, adopted at the Review Conference in Kampala, are currently before the National Congress, undergoing an initial reading in the Chamber of Deputies. 5. Moreover, in order to meet the obligation of States Parties to fully cooperate with the Court in regard to the investigation and prosecution of crimes within its jurisdiction, a roundtable with representatives of the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a draft law on cooperation with the International Criminal Court which will hopefully soon be presented to the National Congress. On 18 July 2009, Law 20.357 was published in the Chilean Official Gazette, defining crimes against humanity and genocide as well as war crimes. Law 20.357 defining crimes against humanity and genocide as well as war crimes is a stand-alone law. However, it also contains amendments to Law 19.640, the organic constitutional law of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Law 20.357 defined crimes against humanity and genocide as well as war crimes by specifically incorporating them into domestic law, without reference to the Rome Statute. ... The Supreme Court of Justice in the case of Pedro Enrique Poblete Cordova ruled that article 5 of the Constitution allows Chilean courts to directly apply provisions of treaties in force to which Chile is a party. Constitution of the Republic of Chile (with amendments through 2012) Article 5 Sovereignty resides intrinsically in the Nation. Its exercise is realized by the people through the plebiscite and periodic elections, and also, by the authorities that this Constitution establishes. No sector of the people nor any individual may arrogate its exercise. The exercise of sovereignty recognizes as a limitation the respect for the essential rights which emanate from human nature. It is the duty of the organs of the State to respect and promote those rights, guaranteed by this Constitution, as well as by the international treaties ratified by Chile and which are in force.

Colombia, for example, regarding the principle of universality outside the scope of the International Criminal Court, understands that it is limited to the power that States have to investigate and prosecute people for the commission of those conducts that have characteristics of crimes and operates with a view to avoiding impunity for serious violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law and particularly. To this effect, the jurisprudence of the Colombian Constitutional Court has been recurrent in pointing out that: ""The principle of universal jurisdiction attributes to all the States of the world the power to assume jurisdiction over those who commit certain crimes that have been especially condemned by the international community, such as genocide, torture or terrorism, provided that such persons are in their national territory, even if the act was not committed there."" In this regard, on previous occasions our delegation has insisted that: ""[...] universal jurisdiction is of a clearly residual nature, and is exercised in relation to crimes allegedly committed in the territory of a State by nationals of another State or to the detriment of nationals of another State and without creating a direct threat to the vital interests of the State exercising jurisdiction The essence of the concept is therefore the legislative authority that a State possesses to extend its prescriptive jurisdiction when there is no link of nationality or territory in the commission of the crime.[...] Universal jurisdiction may also operate under customary law as a corollary to international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity."" Finally, it is imperative to point out that the application of universal jurisdiction for the Colombian State implies respect for the guarantees granted within the framework of any criminal process and in this sense, its exercise must be subject to the provisions of international instruments for the protection of Human Rights in the manner of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights. ... Colombia's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2013) (ii) The scope of the principle of universal jurisdiction in Colombia The Constitutional Court[7] has indicated that universal jurisdiction is a mechanism for international cooperation in combating certain activities which are repudiated by the international community and that it coexists with, but does not supersede, the ordinary jurisdictional competencies of States, as expressly stated in the treaties in which it is established.[8] It is different from international jurisdiction since the latter arose with the adoption of the Rome Statute.  The Constitutional Court has also stated that the principle of universal jurisdiction empowers any of the world's States to exercise jurisdiction over any perpetrator of certain crimes that have been specifically condemned by the international community, such as genocide, torture and terrorism, provided that the person is present in its national territory, even if the act was not committed there. While there is no consensus on the customary nature of this principle, it is enshrined in various international conventions that are binding on Colombia. Thus, at this stage of the development of international law, the principle of universal jurisdiction can be said to apply where it is established in a treaty. The Constitutional Court has also stated that this principle, which refers to the universal jurisdiction of States, should [not] be confused with the jurisdiction of the recently established International Criminal Court; they are two different forms of international cooperation in combating crime, which, while complementary, are different in nature. Thus, once the latter Court becomes operational, it will be a body with jurisdiction independent of that of its States parties and with a scope of jurisdiction that is independent and different from theirs.  With respect to international criminal law, the Constitutional Court has stated that it is in the interests of all States to investigate and punish the most serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, such as genocide, torture and enforced disappearance; it is in the legitimate interest of any State to exercise jurisdiction on behalf of the international community in order to investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of such crimes.[9] On this matter, the Colombian Government has had occasion to comment:[10] 10. In the legislation of Colombia, there is no express provision concerning the application or existence of universal jurisdiction. However, Colombia is a party to various treaties which, in principle, provide for the exercise of national jurisdiction over certain acts that are contrary to international law, generally on the basis of a treaty obligation and the observance of customary international law. 11. Article 93 of the Constitution provides that international treaties and agreements ratified by Congress which recognize human rights and prohibit their restriction during states of emergency shall take precedence over domestic legislation. The rights and obligations enshrined in the Constitution shall be interpreted in accordance with the international human rights treaties ratified by Colombia. In addition, since the Constitution provides that no person shall be subjected to enforced disappearance or to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and prohibits all forms of slavery, servitude and trafficking in human beings, it reflects the level and type of protection that the State must provide in order to suppress and punish, inter alia, violations of such rights, which also constitute international crimes; hence, it reflects the ability of Colombia, in principle, to exercise its jurisdiction in order to punish such acts and thereby safeguard the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. 12. Moreover, criminal law recognizes the growing concern about the suppression of violations that seriously compromise human rights, a situation which the application of universal jurisdiction is intended to mitigate, on the understanding that universal jurisdiction enables States to prosecute and punish acts that are contrary to international law within the limits established in domestic law. 13. Thus, in accordance with the Colombian Constitutional Court, the Penal Code allows for the possibility of exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction in accordance with article 9 of the Constitution, which establishes that Colombia’s foreign relations are based on, inter alia, the principles of international law accepted by Colombia, in particular universal jurisdiction. 14. The Constitutional Court has indicated that universal jurisdiction is a mechanism for international cooperation in combating certain activities which are repudiated by the international community and that it coexists with, but does not supersede, the ordinary jurisdictional competencies of States, as expressly stated in the treaties in which it is established. 15. Many of the crimes punished under domestic criminal law (especially violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law) (see table 1) are fully in line with crimes punished under international law and, thus, those acts can be prosecuted as crimes of international law; this not only makes it possible to extend national jurisdiction to include the exercise of universal jurisdiction, but also resolves the issue of non bis en idem since, in Colombia, express referral to domestic law (the Penal Code) is analogous to referral to an international instrument, which is why domestic courts have the jurisdiction and competence to prosecute such crimes without putting the individual in a situation of double jeopardy. 16. With regard to crimes that threaten the existence and security of the State (see table 1), domestic criminal legislation is clear about the ability to exercise universal jurisdiction. Crimes contained in title XVII of the Penal Code are subject to the jurisdiction and authority of domestic law, in line with international law, particularly as regards, inter alia, peace and security, autonomy, legal equality and integrity. ... The Colombian Constitutional Court's position on universal jurisdiction is that its exercise requires that the act in question be criminalized in its domestic law, whether in substantive or procedural criminal law or in a treaty, signed and ratified by Colombia and incorporated into domestic law, which establishes such jurisdiction as a means of combating specific offences owing to their nature. This shows that Colombia endorses the dualist theory of international law. Universal jurisdiction is considered to be a form of criminal jurisdiction, as are territorial jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction (active or passive) and protective jurisdiction (the State). Therefore, its defining characteristics are the basic principles and guarantees of criminal law, both substantive and procedural: the principles of non bis in idem; nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege. This is Colombia's position in the debate as to whether, in order for legal proceedings to be initiated, the act in question must be established as a crime in the legal system of the State in which it was committed.[12] Furthermore, from a procedural standpoint, it is recognized that it is difficult to gather material and physical evidence and that the accused person must be present in the territory [of the prosecuting State]; therefore, systems for mutual cooperation in judicial matters must be strengthened and [States] should provide each other with substantial assistance in such matters. (iii) The relevant applicable international treaties Some of the relevant hard-law and soft-law instruments adopted by Colombia are:  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (9 December 1948)  Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery (7 September 1956)  Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity (26 November 1968)  Principles of International Cooperation in the Detection, Arrest, Extradition and Punishment of Persons Guilty of War Crimes Against Humanity (3 December 1973)  Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (10 December 1984)  Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (17 July 1998)  Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (15 November 2000)  United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (15 November 2000)  United Nations Convention against Corruption (31 October 2003)  International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (20 December 2006) (iv) The relevant provisions of domestic law The Political Constitution of Colombia With respect to the Political Constitution, two points must be made. First, due process and all relevant criminal-law guarantees are established in article 29, which applies to legal proceedings and stipulates that no one may be prosecuted except under legislation adopted prior to commission of the alleged offence, before a competent judge or tribunal and with respect for all the procedures that govern any trial (legality, legal security, nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege). It also requires favourable treatment and prohibits retroactivity in criminal matters. Lastly, it includes the presumption of innocence, the technical and material rights associated with a defence, and all relevant rules of evidence. Second, articles 93 and 94 of the Constitution describe the relationship between domestic law and international law. Article 93 establishes that international human rights treaties and conventions that have been ratified by Congress and prohibit the restriction of such rights during states of emergency prevail over domestic law and that the rights and duties enshrined in the Constitution are to be interpreted in accordance with the international human rights treaties ratified by Colombia. Article 94 states that the rights and guarantees enshrined in the Constitution and in the international conventions that are currently in force shall not be understood as negating other rights and guarantees which, because they are inherent to humanity, are not expressly mentioned therein. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 906 of 2004) Articles 24, 28 and 29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure use substantive criminal law as a basis for establishing the scope of criminal jurisdiction, which is exclusive, national and covers both offences committed in the national territory and those committed abroad as provided in international treaties signed and ratified by Colombia and in domestic law. Thus, universal jurisdiction may be exercised pursuant to a signed and ratified treaty or to the provisions of domestic law that establish such jurisdiction. The Penal Code (Act No. 599 of 2000) Article 2 of the Code establishes the principle of incorporation, stating that both international treaties and conventions ratified by Colombia and the Political Constitution are part of the Penal Code. Article 6 establishes the principle of legality; it stipulates that no one may be prosecuted except under legislation adopted prior to commission of the alleged offence, before a competent judge or tribunal and with respect for all the procedures that govern any trial. This stipulation also means that overly broad definitions of offences are inadmissible. In addition, legislation adopted subsequent to the commission of an offence is applicable only if it benefits the defendant; the same is true of legal precedents. Article 8 prohibits double jeopardy except as established in international instruments. Articles 14 to 18 deal with matters relating to jurisdiction, including territorial, extraterritorial and personal jurisdiction, and establish the general rules governing jurisdiction. Article 14 deals with territorial jurisdiction; it states that, subject to the exceptions enshrined in international law, criminal proceedings may be instituted in respect of any act committed on Colombian territory. This provision would fully authorize the exercise of international jurisdiction, provided that the rights and guarantees of the accused were respected during the criminal proceedings. Article 16 deals with extraterritorial aspects of criminal law and, as noted above, authorizes the prosecution of offences against certain legally protected interests (offences against the existence and security of the State; offences against the Constitution and the legal order; offences against the economic and social order, with the exception of money-laundering; offences against the public administration; counterfeiting; the financing of terrorism; and the handling of funds related to terrorist activities, even where the accused person has been acquitted or convicted by a foreign court and has been sentenced to a lesser penalty than that envisaged in Colombian law), regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator. In addition, it authorizes the prosecution of Colombian officials who enjoy immunity and commit offences while abroad. Article 16 also provides for the prosecution of an alien who commits an offence against another alien and is in Colombian territory in cases where the sentence provided for in Colombian law is longer than three years, the offence is not political in nature or a request for extradition has been denied by the Government of Colombia. This helps to clarify Colombia's legal situation in the context of the numerous debates on the principle of universal jurisdiction. (v) The relevant domestic judicial practice There are no known cases in which universal jurisdiction has been exercised in Colombia in respect of a violation of human rights committed by an alien in another country or in which extradition has been requested in the exercise of universal jurisdiction. ... [7] The judgements to be consulted in connection with this principle are Constitutional Court judgements C-1189, Carlos Gaviria Díaz (2000); C-554, Clara Inés Vargas Hernández, M.P. (2001); and C-979, Jaime Córdoba Triviño, M.P. (2005). [8] Constitutional Court judgement C-1189, Carlos Gaviria Díaz (2000) [9] Constitutional Court judgment C-979, Jaime Córdoba Triviño, M.P.

[10] As background to these comments, see the information submitted by Colombia in its report to the General Assembly on 20 June 2011 (A/66/93), which provides a brief outline of each State's observations on the scope and application of universal jurisdiction.

[12] This is consistent with views expressed in the final report of the Advisory Committee on the development of the Colombian Government's criminal policy. [Other Statements contain similar information] Colombia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2012) ... The crimes contained in the Rome Statute were already characterized in domestic criminal legislation before Colombia ratified the Statute. Firstly, many punishable acts that constitute crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute are defined in Law 599 of 2000 of the Colombian Criminal Code2, such as murder (articles 103 ff. of the Colombian Criminal Code), apartheid (articles 134A ff. of the Colombian Criminal Code), forced disappearance (article 165 of the Colombian Criminal Code), imprisonment and other serious deprivation of physical freedom in violation of fundamental rules of international law (articles 168 ff. and 175 ff. of the Colombian Criminal Code), torture (article 178 of the Colombian Criminal Code), forcible displacement (article 180 of the Colombian Criminal Code), crimes against sexual freedom and integrity (articles 205 ff. of the Colombian Criminal Code), etc.. Secondly, Chapter I, Part I, Book II of above Code covers Genocide (this section defines both genocide and incitement to genocide). Thirdly, Book II, Part II entitled ""Crimes against Protected Persons and Property under International Humanitarian Law"" covers and defines War Crimes. Chapter I of Book V of Law 906 of 2004, the current Code of Criminal Procedure, enshrines the general principle of international cooperation in criminal matters: Article 484, as amended by article 64 of Law 1453 of 2011. General principle. Investigative and judicial authorities, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shall take the necessary measures to comply with requests for international cooperation submitted in accordance with the Constitution, international instruments and the Laws regulating such matters. Finally, Law 1448 of 10 June 2011, entitled ""Law on Victims and Land Restitution"", provides for attention, assistance and full reparation for the victims of internal armed conflict. in order for Colombia to accede to the Rome Statute and to avoid any inconsistencies between that instrument and domestic norms, the Congress of the Republic approved a constitutional reform with regard to the Rome Statute and the ICC: Legislative Act 02 of 2001. This provision added two paragraphs to article 93 of the Constitution, on the basis of which Colombia was able to become a Member State of the Rome Statute and to recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction.",Complaint or request by the national Attorney General  (Article 16),N/A,N/A,No,N/A,No,N/A,N/A,,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,

In this process of implementing the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the executive branch submitted the draft law “Criminal Repression: Punishment of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity”. Through this draft law, which was approved by the Legislative Assembly on 2 May 2002 and passed as Act No. 8272, Costa Rica established two types of penalties under articles 378 and 379 of the Penal Code dealing with war crimes and crimes against humanity (the crime of genocide has been recognized in the Penal Code since it was adopted in 1970). It should be noted that articles 378 and 379 do not define war crimes and crimes against humanity, but refer to international treaties and instruments on the subject to which Costa Rica is a party, including the Rome Statute, which is mentioned expressly in article 379. Likewise, Act No. 8272 amended article 7 of the Penal Code by characterizing as an international crime the commission of any act that is contrary to international humanitarian law under international treaties signed by Costa Rica and established that Costa Rican courts have jurisdiction over such crimes even if they are committed beyond the borders of Costa Rica and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator. The principle of universal jurisdiction was therefore recognized in 2002; prior to the Penal Code amendment, acts contrary to international humanitarian law committed outside Costa Rican borders were not subject to domestic jurisdiction owing to the principle of territoriality in criminal law. The work of the Costa Rican Committee of International Humanitarian Law (CRCIHL), created by Executive Decree No. 32077-RE of 21 May 2004, as part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship continues the process of incorporating the Rome Statute into Costa Rican legislation. Since its creation, the CRCIHL has worked to align the country’s legislation on the subject to higher standards of protection and to bring greater precision to criminal offences using appropriate legal techniques. On 17 July 2007, in an act to commemorate the IX anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute, the CRCIHL submitted to the Legislative Assembly a proposal to complement draft law No. 16272, “Addition to Book II of the Penal Code, Act No. 4573, of a new Title XVIII, Crimes against Persons and Property Protected by International Humanitarian Law”. The draft in question is now before the Special Human Rights Committee of the Legislative Assembly for review and report. [Statement provides draft provisions for the draft law No. 16272, but it seems the draft bill was tabled in 2009. See https://www.pgaction.org/ilhr/rome-statute/costa-rica.html.] ... Costa Rica's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2010) ... Costa Rica signed the Rome Statute on 7 October 1998. The Legislative Assembly subsequently submitted a draft law on the Statute to the Constitutional Chamber for a preliminary mandatory check on constitutionality; the latter ruled favourably pursuant to a resolution dated 1 November 2000, at 2.56 pm. In that resolution, in addition to issues relating to the process within the Legislative Assembly, the Chamber considered certain substantive aspects of the Rome Statute and of its application in light of Costa Rican law. The Rome Statute was finally approved by the Legislative Assembly under Law No. 8083 of 7 February 2001; on 7 June of the same year, the instrument of ratification was deposited with the Secretary‐General of the United Nations. As mentioned above, and in accordance with article 96(a) of the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction and article 10 of the Political Constitution, the Draft Law on Adoption of the Rome Statute was submitted to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice for a mandatory check on constitutionality, which is required for approval of any international convention or treaty by the legislature. During the process of implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Executive Power presented a Draft Law entitled “Criminal Prosecution. Punishment for War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity”. In 2002, pursuant to the above Draft Law, Costa Rica added two types of crime under articles 378 and 379 of the Criminal Code — described as war crimes and crimes against humanity — pursuant to Law No. 8272, adopted by the Legislative Assembly on 2 May 2002. The crime of genocide has been in the Criminal Code since it was promulgated in 1970. It is worth mentioning that articles 378 and 379 do not directly define war crimes and crimes against humanity, but refer instead to the international treaties and instruments on the matter that Costa Rica is party to; article 379 expressly mentions the Rome Statute. Likewise, Law 8272 amended article 7 of the Criminal Code in order to characterize as international crimes those international humanitarian law violations provided for in the international treaties signed by Costa Rica; in consequence, Costa Rican courts have been given jurisdiction to punish these crimes even if they are committed outside its borders, and independently of the nationality of the perpetrator. Thus for some years the Costa Rican criminal justice system has already been accepting properly qualified cases. The principle of territoriality of criminal laws (Principle of universal jurisdiction) has been applied both to offences against Human Rights, as well as to those contained in the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances signed in Vienna on 19 December 1988, which is applicable as a law of the Republic, inasmuch as, irrespective of the author and location of a crime of the kind defined in the above Convention, any State may prosecute and try it in accordance with the principle of universal justice. In a similar effort towards openness and cooperation, the executive power supported accession to the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court (APIC), which was unanimously approved on 26 November 2009 and submitted to the Plenary of the Legislative Assembly on 24 June 2010.",Prosecutors,Yes,"[Unofficial translation] Law No. 4573: Penal Code Article 16.- The application of criminal law is mandatory for all inhabitants, with the exception of: 1) The foreign heads of State who are in the national territory and the diplomatic agents of other States and other persons who enjoy criminal immunity, according to the international conventions accepted by Costa Rica; and 2) Public officials who, according to the Political Constitution, enjoy immunity.

Multilateral Treaties: - Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide - Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions - Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment - The European Convention on Extradition of 1957 (subsidiary principle of universality - aut dedere aut judicare). 3) State Practice In the Czech Republic, there is no case law available regarding the crimes under international law. The attempts have been made, however, to apply the subsidiary principle of universality in practice, but these have failed to succeed (usually for reason of failure of the State requesting the extradition to provide sufficient evidence for prosecuting the requested person in the Czech Republic, following the denial of extradition; often also for reason of statutes of limitation). In one case, instead of prosecuting the person in the Czech Republic, following the denial of extradition (the extradition had been requested for enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment), the requesting State successfully requested that the Czech Republic takes over execution of the sentence.","Any person, including a victim, can file a criminal complaint (Section 59 of the Criminal Procedure Code).

It should be noted, that under existing Danish law, universal jurisdiction may, as a general rule, only be exercised when the perpetrator is present in Denmark at the time when formal legal proceedings are initiated. 2. The Danish Criminal Code, Under section 8, § 1, no. 5, of the Danish Criminal Code, cf (consolidation) ACI: no. 1034 of 29 October 2009, Denmark has jurisdiction when an act is covered by an international provision under which Denmark is obliged to have criminal jurisdiction. This provision aims at implementing Denmark's treaty obligations regarding inter alia war crimes and other serious crimes under international law. In addition, the provision establishes Danish jurisdiction where Denmark may be obliged to have criminal jurisdiction under UN Security Council resolutions and decisions or directives adopted by the Council of the European Union. Section 8, § 1, no. 6, of the Criminal Code establishes Danish jurisdiction where extradition of a person for prosecution in another country is rejected, and the act, provided it has been committed within the territory of a foreign state, is punishable according to the law of the state in which it was committed (dual criminality), and the act is punishable under Danish law and may be sanctioned with a sentence longer than imprisonment for one year. Section 8a of the Danish Criminal Code provides that an act committed outside the territory of the Danish State is subject to Danish criminal jurisdiction where the act is covered by the Statute of the International Criminal court, provided that the act has been committed by a person who is a Danish national or has his abode or residence in Denmark, or by a person who is present in Denmark at the rime when charges are raised. Under. section 8b of the Danish Criminal Code, an act coveted by section 183a of the Act (the unlawful takeover of an aircraft or a ship), when committed outside the territory of the Danish state, is subject to Danish criminal jurisdiction, provided that the act has been committed by a person who is a Danish national or has his abode or residence in Denmark, or by a person who is present in Denmark at the time when formal legal proceedings are initiated. Under section 12 of the Danish Criminal Code, the exercise of jurisdiction with reference to the above-mentioned provisions is limited by applicable international law. This provision refers to all relevant rules of international law, including immunity of state officials and diplomatic immunity. Thereby, customary rules on immunity, as well as treaties on immunity, to which Denmark is a party, may exclude the exercise of Danish jurisdiction where the Danish Criminal Code would otherwise provide for such jurisdiction. Furthermore, in cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the legitimate interest of Denmark in exercising jurisdiction may be balanced against the interest of other states in retaining (exclusive) jurisdiction. The drafting of section 12 provides for the consideration of all relevant faces of the case as well as evidence of the state of international law at the rime the specific jurisdictional issue arises. 3. Danish Administration of Justice Act Sections 721-722 of the Danish Administration of Justice Act, cf. (consolidation) Aa no. 1053 of 29 October 2009, refer to the prosecutorial discretion of the Danish Public Prosecutor to assess whether an indictment should or should not be initiated. Such an assessment includes consideration of whether a successful prosecution will entail disproportionate difficulties, costs, or time constraints. Moreover, indictment may not be initiated if mitigating circumstances would make the indictment unreasonable. These principles also apply to situation where an indictment has been initiated but evidence and circumstances prove to cause disproportionate difficulties as described above. In these situations the Public Prosecutor may chose to discontinue the case at his discretion 4. Judicial practice The following Supreme Court Case from 1995 may be mentioned as an example of a case where Denmark has exercised jurisdiction under section 8, § I., no. 5} of the Danish Criminal Code (cf case No. U1995.838H): The defendant, who was present in Denmark when the charges against him were raised, was accused of having committed serious violence against fellow inmates in a Croatian camp for war prisoners, in which the defendant was exercising limited authority. The acts Were held to be punishable under the third as well as the: fourth of the Geneva Conventions. Thus, the violations were subject to Danish jurisdiction under section 8 (5) of the Criminal Code (as Denmark was obliged under the relevant conventions to have criminal jurisdiction). The defendant was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment and expelled from Denmark permanently. In another case from 1998, the Prosecutor General considered the scope of the abovementioned section B (5) of the Danish Criminal Code. A group of Chilean citizens, who were resident ill Denmark, had reported former president of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, to the Danish police accusing him of having ordered, designed, or upheld a regime, in which the applicants had been exposed to arrest, torture and degrading treatment in Chile during the years 1973-88. At the time of the police notification, Augusto Pinochet was a British resident, After thorough consideration of, inter alia, the preparatory works of the Danish Criminal Code's section 8 (5) the Prosecutor General concluded that Denmark lacked criminal jurisdiction in the specific case, due to the fact that the alleged perpetrator was not present in Denmark at the time when formal legal proceedings would otherwise be initiated against him. This understanding of section 8 (5) was later upheld by the Danish Ministry of Justice. 5. Applicable treaties Denmark is a patty to numerous treaties which embody the principle of universal jurisdiction. A list of those treaties is very extensive and will be provided at a later Stage.","Anybody can report an offence and the Danish Public Prosecutor has discretion to assess whether an indictment should be initiated pursuant to article 721-722 of the Danish Administration of Justice Act 2009. The assessment includes considerations of whether successful prosecution will entail disproportionate difficulties, costs, or time contrsaints, or if mitigating circumstances would make the indictment unreasonable. If circumstances pose disproportionate difficulties, the Public Prosecutor may also discontinue the case. There is no legal definition of “victim” under Danish law, but the term is to be interpreted narrowly, and only applied to those whom the penal provisions seek to protect.  Generally, a victim can be defined a person who is directly affected by a crime. The victim is not a formal party to the trial and is traditionally considered a witness.

Article 49.- Genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are imprescriptible. For these purposes and those of article 56, those contained in international treaties are considered as such, regardless of the legal classification attributed to them in national laws.",Yes,"Dominican Republic's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2022) ... The Dominican Constitution, revised and amended in 2015, establishes in its Article 26, that: ""The Dominican Republic is a member state of the international community, open to cooperation and attached to the norms of international law, consequently: 1) It recognizes and applies the norms of international, general and American law, to the extent that its public authorities have adopted them; 2) The norms in force of ratified international conventions shall govern in the domestic sphere, once published officially. Likewise, Article 56 of the Dominican Code of Criminal Procedure grants jurisdiction to Dominican courts to exercise universal jurisdiction over certain crimes. The Dominican legislation establishes in its criminal procedural code that attributes the power to its judges and criminal courts, to judge Dominicans and foreigners who commit punishable acts, committed totally or partially in the Dominican territory, or whose effects are produced in it, except for the cases excepted in international treaties or conventions adopted by the public bodies or in the principles recognized by the international and American law. The Dominican Republic has defined in the international legal framework of its jurisdiction which court is competent for cases in which the application of universal jurisdiction is necessary. In this sense, the Dominican Constitution states that: ""In cases in which the national courts hear punishable acts committed outside the national territory, the Court of First Instance of the National District is competent"". The Supreme Court of Justice of the Dominican Republic has pronounced on a few occasions in relation to the principle of universal jurisdiction, citing in its recitals the articles of the Dominican legislation related to the cases, and although in the referred texts it is not specified which are those cases, it is evident that these are matters of great transcendence. Likewise, we consider that according to the connotation of universality that certain facts corresponding to organized crime have, whose extreme seriousness and the fact that they overflow the border limits, make them crimes against humanity, and therefore the prosecution and punishment of their perpetrators should be allowed by all the States victims of such criminal behavior. Universal jurisdiction has become a necessary tool in the fight against the negligence of certain actions or offenses committed, whose gravity makes the application of justice at a global level permissive, so that from the Judiciary of the Dominican Republic it is being applied and considered to the extent of the needs of each case. Dominican Republic's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... Article 26 of the Constitution of the Republic, which was promulgated on 26 January 2010, provides that: The Dominican Republic is a member State of the international community, open to cooperation and bound to adhere to the provisions of international law. Therefore: (1) It recognizes and applies the provisions of general international law and American law, in so far as its public authorities have adopted them; (2) The provisions of the international conventions that it has ratified shall be applicable as domestic law following their official publication... Article 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure grants Dominican courts the competence to exercise universal jurisdiction over certain crimes. Article 56: Criminal jurisdiction is exercised by the judges and courts established by this Code and applies to Dominicans and foreigners for purposes of the investigation and prosecution of offences which are committed fully or partially in the national territory or which produce effects therein, unless otherwise provided in international treaties or conventions adopted by public organs or in the principles recognized by general international law and American law. The national courts have the authority to prosecute cases involving genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity, wherever committed, provided that the accused person is resident, even temporarily, in the country or that the acts caused harm to Dominicans. In addition, article 62 of the Code establishes the competent tribunal for application of the principle of universal jurisdiction, indicating that: ""The Santo Domingo court of first instance shall have competence for cases in which a national court must investigate offences committed outside the national territory"". The Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic has ruled on the principle of universal jurisdiction on several occasions, as, for example, in the 16 December 2009 judgment of the Criminal Chamber (now Division) of the Supreme Court of Justice. The judgment states: ...with regard to the jurisdiction and competence of the Dominican criminal courts, article 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure grants our courts the legal capacity to investigate and prosecute only offences of which Dominican or foreign persons are accused and which were committed fully or partially in the national territory or produced effects therein... Furthermore, article 62 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that Dominican courts may investigate offences committed outside of the national territory -- which thus fall into the category of universal jurisdiction -- and although that provision does not specify the offences in question, it is clear that these are very serious crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, money-laundering, international drug trafficking, etc., which does not apply in this case...""** The judgment also states that owing to the universal nature of some offences committed by organized crime, which were, until recently, unheard of, and to the extreme seriousness and transboundary nature that define them as crimes against humanity, all the States that have fallen victim to these offences must be permitted to prosecute and sentence the perpetrators. Universal jurisdiction has become a necessary tool for combating impunity for certain actions or offences, the seriousness of which justifies the application of justice at the international level. The judiciary of the Dominican Republic therefore applies and considers universal jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis.",Public Prosecutors,Yes,"[Unofficial Translation] Criminal Code of the Dominican Republic (Law No. 550-14 of 26 December 2014) Article 380.

In order to comply with Resolution ICC-ASP/5/Res.3 of the Assembly of States Parties of 1 December 2006, the Ecuadorian State has attempted to incorporate all of the mandatory norms of the Rome Statute into its own legislation, focusing its efforts on the proper characterization of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression. The Draft Full Organic Criminal Code incorporates the various legal definitions stipulated in the Rome Statute, and was submitted to the National Assembly by the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Worship on 13 October 2011. The adoption and subsequent publication of the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador in Official Gazette 449 of 20 October 2008 made the promotion and full implementation of the Rome Statute possible; it included a provision in article 80 that “actions/proceedings and penalties for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, forced disappearance of persons or crimes of aggression against a State shall not be subject to any statute of limitations. No amnesty shall be given for any of these crimes”. In presenting and promoting the Draft Full Organic Criminal Code, Ecuador is proposing to define the crimes provided for under article 5 of the Rome Statute, as well as making them imprescriptible, and characterizing them as punishable by the penalties applicable to genocide, aggression, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The crimes provided for in the Rome Statute are directly incorporated into Ecuadorian law, for example through the current Criminal Code, into which a provision for the imprescriptibility of such crimes has been introduced, as well as into the Draft Full Organic Criminal Code, which provides definitions of genocide, aggression, crimes against humanity and war crimes, together with their respective penalties, characterizing them as offences against humanity in the First Part of Chapter One, Serious Human Rights Violations and Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law. ...","[Unofficial Translation] Organic Comprehensive Criminal Code (2014, as amended 2022) Art. 432.- Private prosecution They may bring a private accusation: 1.

We would like to reiterate once again the solid legal basis that our country has to guarantee the recognition and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction, both at the normative and jurisprudential levels. In particular, our Criminal Code recognizes this principle in its article 10, according to which, its application is not conditioned to the existence of some type of connection, that is to say, it is not necessary the concurrence of the active personality principle or even the presence of the alleged offender in the Salvadoran territory. According to our legislation, for the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction it is only required that the conduct has affected goods protected internationally by specific covenants or norms of international law or that it implies a serious affectation to universally recognized human rights. It should also be considered that the greater or lesser operability of the principle of universal jurisdiction depends not only on the procedural recognition or legal authorization, but also, from a substantive point of view, that the criminal conduct has been incorporated into the domestic law of that State. In relation to the above, our criminal legislation incorporates some of these important crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, forced disappearances, slavery, and other criminal offenses that are developed in Chapter XIX under the title of crimes against humanity. On the other hand, at the international level, El Salvador has ratified several instruments related to the protection of human rights, such is the case of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the American Convention on Human Rights; and in recent years, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which guarantees a greater commitment in the fight against impunity of the crimes referred to in the Statute. In the jurisdictional sphere, recently, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, through the resolution for protection 414-2021, dated January 5, 2022, specified that the activation of the universal jurisdiction takes place for those crimes of imprescriptible character, recognized by international law, to confront and overcome impunity and ensure justice, truth and full reparation for the victims. Additionally, the Chamber considered that the facts constituting crimes against humanity are extremely serious and the patterns, behavior or practices of violence in which they occurred are absolutely reprehensible in view of the impact they have had on the victims, the offended parties, society and the international community. El Salvador's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2021) ... The Rome Statute was ratified by means of Legislative Decree 197 of 26 November 2015, which was published in Official Journal 236, Volume 409, on 22 December 2015. The Statute was ratified, and has been incorporated into the Criminal Code, some elements of crimes into secondary legislation. Given the fact that El Salvador is a State Party to the Rome Statute, pursuant to its domestic legislation ratified treaties prevail over national legislation; the provisions of the Statute must be strictly complied with in the different modalities of cooperation contemplated therein. El Salvador's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2020) ... El Salvador has a solid legal framework that regulates the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction with respect to those conducts that affect assets protected internationally by specific agreements or norms of International Law or that seriously affect universally recognized Human Rights; specifically, article 10 of the Criminal Code regulates universal jurisdiction as an independent principle, the application of which is not subject to the place where the crime was committed, nor to the individuals involved in it. Additionally, the national jurisprudence incorporates in its pronouncement the definition established in the Princeton Principles of Universal Jurisdiction, according to which certain crimes are so detrimental to international interests that States are authorized, and even obliged, to initiate legal action. against the perpetrator, regardless of where the crime was committed or the nationality of the perpetrator or victim. In the same sense, national jurisprudence has determined that crimes against humanity ""seriously shock the moral conscience of humanity and human dignity at a universal level"" whose imprescriptible nature recognized by International Law ""gives rise to the activation of the jurisdiction to confront and overcome impunity, and ensure justice, truth and full reparation for the victims. On the other hand, in institutional practice, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has developed the Policy for the Criminal Prosecution of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity that occurred in the context of the armed conflict, which establishes criteria and guidelines for the prosecution of such crimes, in order to carry out effective and responsible investigations, which enable victims to access justice, know the truth of the events that occurred and the reparation derived from the exercise of criminal action in the competent courts. Based on the foregoing, my delegation concludes that the national legal framework and its jurisprudence constitute an essential foundation to reaffirm the application of universal jurisdiction, and that they are in harmony with various international legal instruments on the protection of Human Rights, of the which, El Salvador is a party and, according to article 144 of the Constitution, constitute laws of the Republic. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2019) ... The Salvadoran State recognizes that in order to construct the necessary legal elements of this principle, it is necessary to have a solid normative foundation for its application. Thus, our state practice is aimed at promoting greater efforts to protect such rights, especially, before the commission of serious crimes. In this regard, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has included in its jurisprudential line that: ""By nature, these crimes are imprescriptible according to international law; therefore, internal measures, both legislative and as of another nature, that prevent the investigation, the clarification of the truth, the application of an independent justice and that deny justice and comprehensive reparation to the victims, leaving similar crimes in impunity, which are subject in all circumstances to the persecution, extradition, trial and criminal punishment of those responsible; therefore, they cannot be subject to amnesty or pardon."" (Unconstitutionality ruling 44-2013/145-2013, dated July 13, 2016). .... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2018) ... Thus, regarding the regulation contemplated in the national legal system, I wish to highlight article 10 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which allows the application of criminal law to crimes committed by any person in a place not subject to the Salvadoran jurisdiction; provided that they affect goods protected by norms of international law or imply a serious affectation to universally recognized human rights. On the other hand, El Salvador provides in its constitutional law that international treaties concluded with other states or with international organizations also constitute laws of the Republic when they enter into force in accordance with the provisions of the same treaty and the Constitution. Within the framework of the issue that concerns us, our country is part of International norms whose regulation Incorporates the most serious crimes of humanity and on which the application of the principle relative to universal jurisdiction proceedings. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2017) ... In this sense, Salvadoran legislation provides in article 10 of its Penal Code, the principle of universal jurisdiction, in order to allow the application of criminal law to crimes committed by any person in a place not subject to Salvadoran jurisdiction; provided that they affect goods internationally protected by norms of international law or imply a serious affectation to universally recognized human rights. For its part, from our jurisprudential field, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of El Salvador established an important precedent by declaring the unconstitutionality of various articles of the General Amnesty Law for the Consolidation of the Faz , which was in force at the internal level with respect to different crimes committed during the Salvadoran armed conflict in the years 1980 to 1992. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2014) ... On the other hand, Mr. President, as has been reported in previous sessions, the Republic of El Salvador in its internal legislation expressly recognizes universal jurisdiction as a principle that -according to what is established in article 10 of the Penal Code in force– allows the application of Salvadoran criminal law to crimes committed by any person in a place not subject to Salvadoran jurisdiction, provided that they affect property internationally protected by specific agreements or norms of international law or that they seriously affect the universally recognized human rights. We would like to comment on this provision again, because this mode of regulation is particular, since, in our legislation, the principle of universal jurisdiction is not restricted to an exhaustive list of criminal types, but can be used for a variety of serious crimes that comply with the aforementioned requirements, thus allowing its application to be assessed based on the principle of harmfulness, which constitutes a principle of constitutional rank that governs all criminal proceedings. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... Current status of the principle of universal jurisdiction in El Salvador As established in the report submitted last year, the principle of universal jurisdiction is not provided for in Salvadoran constitutional law at the level of domestic legislation. However, the principle has been recognized in secondary legislation within the current Criminal Code, which has not been amended for several years. The provision reads as follows: Principle of universality Article 10 — Salvadoran criminal law shall also apply to offences committed by anyone in a place not subject to Salvadoran jurisdiction, provided that they affect rights that are internationally protected by specific agreements or norms of international law or seriously violate universally recognized human rights. Based on the wording of this article, under the principle of universality, national criminal courts are authorized to investigate certain offences, regardless of where they were committed or of the nationality of either the perpetrators or the victims of the offences. It is apparent that the principle of universality was formulated very broadly, and will no doubt be the object of judicial interpretation in due course. However, we believe that the nature and basic context of the principle of universal jurisdiction must be analysed, independently of its eventual application by national courts. We have also identified several elements that, in our view, are closely related to the application of the principle and which may function as useful tools in defining its scope. ...","State prosecutors are the only ones who can promote action in court for these crimes.

Lastly, Estonia would like to draw attention to the regulation in force in the Estonian Penal Code. Section 8 states that regardless of the law of the place of commission of an act, the penal law of Estonia shall apply to any acts committed outside the territory of Estonia if punishability of the act arises from an international obligation binding on Estonia. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... The principle of universal jurisdiction is provided in Estonian legislation by section 8 of the Penal Code: ""§ 8. Applicability of penal law to acts against internationally protected legal rights Regardless of the law of the place of commission of an act, the penal law of Estonia shall apply to an act committed outside the territory of Estonia if the punishability of the act arises from an international agreement binding on Estonia.» This provision has not been applied in Estonian practice yet. Although section 8 contains no exclusive reference thereto, universal jurisdiction could most probably be applied in connection with penal provisions protecting humanity and international security contained in international agreements and customary law that have been codified in Chapter 8 of the Special Part of the Penal Code ""Offences Against Humanity and International Security"". In Chapter 8 the following offences have been listed: crimes against humanity(§ 89), genocide(§ 90), aggression(§ 91), propaganda for war (§ 92), manufacture and distribution of prohibited weapons (§ 93), violation of measures necessary for application of international sanction (§ 931), war crimes and offences against international security. However, Estonian jurisdiction shall universally extend to the offences mentioned in Chapter 8 only if the punishability of respective act arises from an international agreement binding on Estonia. In some respect the compositions set out in Chapter 8 are broader than the definitions of international crimes, such as genocide, in international agreements, and therefore each individual ease must be approached separately, in order to determine the applicability of universal jurisdiction. On the other hand, section 8 enables universal jurisdiction to be applied also to other offences codified in the Penal Code, if the punishability thereof arises from an international agreement binding on Estonia. Taking into account the lack of practice, it is however rather improbable that universal jurisdiction would be applied, e.g., in case of transnational bribery or other offences which are not usually considered to be offences against international public order or breaches of erga omnes obligations. ... Estonia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2010) ... The Embassy of Republic of Estonia presents its compliments to the Secretariat of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and with reference to the Secretariat's note No. ICC-ASP/9/SP/PA/21 of 20 May 2010 has the honour to provide the following information with respect to promotion of the ratification and full implementation of the Rome Statute. The Rome Statute has become a part of Estonian legal order on 1 July 2002 during the reform of Estonian substantive and procedural penal law. Estonia has not faced any obstacles, including constitutional issues to ratification or full implementation of the Rome Statute. The provisions intended to implement the Statute have been incorporated into the Penal Code (in force since 1 September 2002) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (in force since 1 July 2004). The substantive crimes are incorporated into the Estonian Penal Code without reference to the Statute, e.g. crimes against humanity- section 89, genocide - section 90, aggression - section 91. The modes of cooperation have been provided for in the Code of Criminal Procedure, e.g. principle of cooperation - section 433, extradition - section 439, surrender of persons - section 491. However, if a rule of national law should be in contradictory to a provision of an international commitment, the latter prevails.","[Third Party Translation] Code of Criminal Procedure (2003, amendments through 2022) § 16.

Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... The scope of application of the criminal law of Finland is provided for in Chapter 1 of the Criminal Code. That Chapter includes provisions on offences committed in Finland (section 1 ), offences connected to a Finnish vessel (section 2), offences directed at Finland (section 3), offences in public office and military offences (section 4), offences directed at a Finn (section 5), and offences committed by a Finn (section 6). Section 7 of Chapter 1 of the Criminal Code provides for the universal jurisdiction of the Finnish courts. Under section 7(1 ), Finnish law shall apply to an offence committed outside of Finland where the punishability of the act is, regardless of the place of commission, based on an international agreement binding on Finland or another statute or regulation internationally binding on Finland (in the Criminal Code such offences are referred to as ""international offences""). Further provisions on the application of section 7 are issued by Decree. The relevant Decree sets out a detailed list of crimes to which Finnish criminal law can be applied on the basis of universal jurisdiction, as well as of the international conventions providing the legal basis thereof. An unofficial English translation of Chapter 1 of the Criminal Code and of the Decree is attached to this verbal note. The translation takes account of amendments introduced to the Decree through December 2008. Since then, such nuclear terrorism as is referred to in the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (Treaties of Finland 6/2009), and such torture or other punishable act as is deemed an offence referred to in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Treaties of Finland 60/1989) have been introduced into the Decree. ... The categorisation of unlawful acts as ""international offences"" is thus in most cases based on an international agreement that has been ratified by Finland. Most of those agreements place States Parties under an obligation to prosecute offenders unless they are extradited to another State, and the relevant offences are punishable in the Finnish legal system irrespective of the place of commission of the offence, the offender or the applicable law of the place of commission. As a general rule, a criminal case shall not be tried in Finland without a prosecution order by the Prosecutor-General where the offence was committed abroad (Section 12 of Chapter 1 ). Section 13 of Chapter 1 provides for situations where a judgment has already been passed in another State. If an international agreement binding on Finland or another statute or regulation that is internationally binding on Finland for some reason restricted the scope of application of the criminal law of Finland, the relevant provisions of such agreement or other instrument would apply in accordance with section 15 of Chapter 1. In addition, the scope of application of Finnish law might be restricted on the basis of generally recognised rules of international law. The first case tried by a Finnish court under the principle of universal jurisdiction is currently pending before a district court. In that case, the defendant was residing in Finland and was arrested as his name had appeared on a list of suspects published by the authorities of his country of origin. It was found that the person concerned could not be extradited under the Finnish law and therefore he was charged in Finland on the basis of universal jurisdiction. ... Finland's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2009) ... The substantive crimes have been incorporated in the Finnish Criminal Code. When the Statute was ratified by Finland in December 2000 no major amendments were introduced in the Finnish Criminal Code. It was acknowledged, however, that for the national courts to be fully able to exercise jurisdiction over crimes within the Court's jurisdiction it was necessary to amend the Criminal Code. The amendments with regard to the criminalizations of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Chapter 11 of the Criminal Code as well as the new provisions implementing Articles 28 and 33 of the Statute were adopted on 11 April 2008 and entered into force on 1 May 2008. An unofficial English translation of Chapter 11 of the Criminal Code is annexed to this response.","Parties to an investigation include the injured party and other persons whose rights, interests, or obligations may be affected by the offence. When necessary, the Head Investigator can decide whether or not a person is an injured party. There is no legal definition of an injured party, but this has been developed by case law. An injured party is a person whose interests has directly been injured by an offence (i.e. the victim of the offence) or one who has is entitled to a legal claim (e.g. compensation for damage) directly based on the offence.

To implement the provisions of Rome Statute into national law, two laws have been enacted: Law No. 2002-268 of 26 February 2002 on cooperation with the International Criminal Court, and Law No. 2010-930 of 9 August 2010 amending the criminal law to accord with the requirements of the International Criminal Court. Although the Rome Statute does not require States Parties to amend their criminal law by specifically incorporating the offences falling under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, the French authorities nonetheless opted to supplement and amend domestic law by inserting the necessary provisions to achieve comprehensive criminalization of the crimes and other offences falling within the Court’s jurisdiction. Law No. 2010-930 of 9 August 2010 amending the criminal law to accord with the requirements of the International Criminal Court introduced legislation to criminalize in French law all of the offences over which the Court has jurisdiction. ... France's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... 1. The rule in French domestic law: presence on French territory French law has accepted a specific definition of universal jurisdiction. This is laid out in article 689-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as follows: “In accordance the international agreements referred to in the following articles, any person who has committed one of the crimes listed in these articles outside the territory of the French Republic may be prosecuted and convicted by the French courts if s/he is in France. The provisions of the present article apply also to any attempt to commit these crimes, whenever such is punishable by law.” Thus, exercise of universal jurisdiction in France requires the presence of the suspect within national territory at the time proceedings are initiated in France, and precludes the initiation of proceedings in the absence of that person. In practice, therefore, the jurisdiction of the courts is “quasi-universal”. It is also limited by the need to incorporate international agreements giving jurisdiction to the national judges into French law. 2. International agreements incorporated into French law According to the terms of articles 689 and 689-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), French law requires that an international agreement be incorporated into French domestic law. The provisions of the agreement must give national courts the jurisdiction to prosecute and sentence the person suspected of committing the offences addressed in the agreement.  Articles 689-2 to 689-10 of the CCP list the international agreements that can give rise to proceedings before French judges: – Article 689-2 of the CCP: the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted in New York on 10 December 1984; – Article 689-3 of the CCP: the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, signed in Strasbourg on 27 January 1977, and the Agreement concerning the application of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism among the member States of the European Communities, done at Dublin on 4 December 1979; – Article 689-4 of the CCP: the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, opened for signature in Vienna and New York on 3 March 1980; – Article 689-5 of the CCP: the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf, done at Rome on 10 March 1988; – Article 689-6 of the CCP: the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed in The Hague on 16 December 1970, and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed in Montreal on 23 September 1971; – Article 689-7 of the CCP: the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, done at Montreal on 24 February 1988; – Article 689-8 of the CCP: the Protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities’ financial interests, done at Dublin on 27 September 1996, and the Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union, done at Brussels on 26 May 1997; – Article 689-9 of the CCP: the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, opened for signature in New York on 12 January 1998; – Article 689-10 of the CCP: the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, opened for signature in New York on 10 January 2000. France has signed and ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. This international convention requires States parties to take “such measures as may be necessary to establish [their] competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance when the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction”. Provisions amending French legislation will shortly be submitted to Parliament.  Lastly, Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport led to the introduction in France, through article 689-12 of the CCP, of a “quasi-universal” jurisdiction provision for certain road offences. ... 4. The practice of French courts At the present time, two people have been convicted in France, in absentia, on the basis of the “quasi-universal” jurisdiction of the French courts according to article 689-2 of the CCP. – In a ruling dated 1 July 2005, the Gard court of assizes  entenced Mr. Ely Ould Dah, a Mauritanian citizen, to 10 years imprisonment and €15,000 in damages and interest for each of his victims, for acts of torture committed in Mauritania between 1990 and 1991. That conviction, the first of its kind in France, has led to a dispute before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The complainant has indicated the existence of a Mauritanian amnesty law making his conviction in France unforeseeable. The ECHR nonetheless concluded, in a decision dated 17 March 2009, that France had not misinterpreted the legality principle guaranteed in article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. – In a ruling dated 15 December 2008, the Bas-Rhin court of assizes convicted Khaled Ben Said, a Tunisian citizen, to eight years in prison for having ordered the torture of a Tunisian woman at the police station in Jendouba, while he was Police Commissioner, in October 1996. The public prosecutor’s office, which had requested acquittal, has appealed the decision and the appeal will be heard by the Meurthe-et-Moselle court of assizes. To date, there are three cases ongoing in France for acts of torture committed in the Republic of the Congo, Algeria and Cambodia. With regard to Cambodia, the Investigation Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal handed down a ruling on 26 January 2010 approving the pursuit of investigations for a case concerning acts of kidnapping followed by acts of torture and disappearance, committed in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. Fifteen cases are also ongoing within the framework of the laws adapting French legislation to the provisions of the Statutes of the two International Criminal Tribunals. These concern acts committed in Rwanda (fourteen are before the Paris High Court and one is before the Paris Army Tribunal, since members of the French military are implicated). T","Anyone considered as a direct victim under Article of the Code of Criminal procedure (CPP). Under the French legal system victims and NGOs can trigger the opening of investigations by filing a complaint to a public prosecutor or by submitting a civil party petition to an investigating judge.

The Gabonese constitution establishes as a fundamental principle the criminal responsibility of the high representatives of the State before the High Court of Justice for acts committed in the exercise of their functions and qualified as crimes at the time they were committed. In this context, universal jurisdiction, the scope of which must be limited, must be complementary and respectful of the principle of territoriality and cannot contradict the jurisdiction of national courts. We consider that the criminal responsibility rests in the first place with the country in which the most serious crimes were committed, that is to say the war crime, the genocide and the crimes against humanity. Cor celo makes it possible to strengthen the sovereignty of States by allowing them to remain the primary guardians of national and international rules. In this respect, it is essential to underline that universal jurisdiction should apply only when a state does not intend to exercise jurisdiction over the crime committed. The Constitutive Act of the African Union recognizes the African Union's right to sue for serious crimes when the circumstances so require. ....","For EJT, the prosecution of offenses can only be exercised at the request of the Public Prosecutor upon prior complaint from the victim or his heirs, or upon official denunciation. by the authority of the country where the act was committed.

There are two modalities in which Georgia exercises its criminal jurisdiction - territoriality and extraterritoriality. The latter, according to Article 5 of the Criminal Code of Georgia (CCG) is based on principles of active personality (due regard paid to double criminality requirement), protective principle and principle of universal jurisdiction. The latter is stipuated in Article 5(3) of the CCG which is read as follows ""a foreign citizen or stateless person shall be criminally liable for a crime committed abroad ... if criminal liability for committing the crime is established by an international treaty to which Georgia is a State party."" Georgia is a State party to the following international documents envisaging to greater or lesser degree the principle of universal jurisdiction - the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocol I of 1977 and the Statute of International Criminal Court (as amended by the 2010 Kampala Amendments). Furthermore, according to Article 6 of the Law of Georgia on International Treaties of Georgia the latter treaties shall be an integral part of the legislation of Georgia. The same provision further stipulated that international treaties to which Georgia is a party shall prevail over domestic normative acts unless they contradict the Constitution, constitutional law or constitutional concordat of Georgia and that provisions of duly published treaties determining the specific rights and obligations and not requiring transposition in domestic legislation by adopting specific acts, shall be directly applicable in Georgia. To transfer its international obligations to domestic legislation Georgia has respectively amended its criminal legislation. The CCG contains a separate chapter entirely dedicated to crimes against humanity and violations of international humanitarian law. In particular, Chapter XLVII of the Code outlaws the following actions * ""Planning, preparation, commencement or execution of an act of aggression"" (Article 404) * ""Calling for planning, preparation, commencement or execution of an act of aggression"" (Article 405) * ""Manufacturing, purchasing or selling weapons of mass destruction"" (Article 406) * ""Genocide"" (Article 407) * ""Crime against humanity"" (Article 408) * ""Ecocide"" (Article 409) * ""Participation of mercenaries in armed conflicts or military action"" (Article 410) * ""Intentional breach of the provisions of the international humanitarian law during armed conflict"" (Article 411) * ""International breach of provisions of the international humanitarian law during armed conflicts between states or within a state, by endangering health or by mutilation"" (Article 412) * ""Other violations of the provisions of the international humanitarian law"" (Article 413) ... Georgia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2013) ... On 14 August 2003 the Parliament of Georgia adopted Law of Georgia on Cooperation of Georgia with the International Criminal Court.' It is separate, comprehensive legal act that governs matters of cooperation between the International Criminal Court and Georgia, determines national state agency responsible for cooperation between the International Court and Georgia, defines forms of mutual legal assistance in the course of cooperation. The Law is composed of 9 Chapters and 50 Articles. Chapter I contains general provisions, Chapter II defines national agency responsible for cooperation with the International Court and its functions, Chapter III deals with jurisdictional aspects of the International Court, Chapter IV regulates procedures regarding request of the International Court, Chapter V determines procedural aspects of surrender of a person to the International Court, Chapter VI relates to different forms of cooperation between Georgia and the International Court, Chapter VII contains appeal procedures, Chapter VIII regulates execution of the International Court decisions and Chapter IX contains transitional and final provisions.

At the same time, other Georgian legal acts contain relevant provisions indispensable for ensuring of cooperation between Georgia and the International Court: Law of Georgia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia, etc. Core crimes of international concern had been included in relevant legislative act before the Statute came into force for Georgia. On 22 July 1999 the Parliament of Georgia adopted a new Criminal Code of Georgia. According to Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Code it establishes the ground for criminal liability, determines which conduct shall be criminal and metes out relevant punishment or other punitive measure. In Chapter XLVII (Crimes against Peace of Humanity, Security and International Humanitarian law) of the Code following crimes have been included: yakova Preparation for and Waging of Aggressive War (Article 404) Calling for Unleashing of Aggressive War (Article 405) Production, Purchase or Sale Of Weapon of Mass Destruction (Article 406) Genocide (Article 407) Crimes against Humanity (Article 408) Ecocide (Article 409) Participation of Mercenary into Armed Conflict or Hostility (Article 410) Intentional Violation of Norms of International Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict (Article 411) Intentional Violation of Norms of International Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict of International or Non-international Character by Endangering Health or by Mutilation (Article 412) - Other Violation of Norms of International Humanitarian Law (Article 413). Georgia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2009) ... For achieving full implementation of the Rome Statute in Georgian national legislation the Parliament of Georgia adopted implementing legislation and also incorporated substantive provisions of the Statute in the pre-existing law. In August 14, 2003 the Parliament of Georgia adopted the ""Law of Georgia on the Cooperation of Georgia with the International Criminal Court"". The law established procedural framework of cooperation of Georgia with the ICC. Furthermore, relevant enactments had been made to the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia.

Section 153c [Non-Prosecution of Offences Committed Abroad] (1) The public prosecution office may dispense with prosecuting criminal offences 1. which have been committed outside the territorial scope of this statute, or which an inciter or an accessory before the fact to an act committed outside the territorial scope of this statute has committed within the territorial scope thereof; 2. which a foreigner committed in Germany on a foreign ship or aircraft; 3. if in the cases referred to in sections 129 and 129a, in each case also in conjunction with section 129b subsection (1) of the Criminal Code, the group does not, or does not mainly, exist in Germany and the participatory acts committed in Germany are of lesser importance or are limited to mere membership. Offences for which there is criminal liability pursuant to the Code of Crimes against International Law shall be subject to Section 153f. (2) The public prosecution office may dispense with prosecuting a criminal offence if a sentence for the offence has already been executed against the accused abroad, and the sentence which is to be expected in Germany would be negligible after taking the foreign sentence into account or if the accused has already been acquitted abroad by a final judgment in respect of the offence. (3) The public prosecution office may also dispense with prosecuting criminal offences committed within, but through an act committed outside, the territorial scope of this statute, if the conduct of proceedings poses the risk of serious detriment to the Federal Republic of Germany or if other public interests of overriding importance present an obstacle to prosecution. (4) If charges have already been preferred, the public prosecution office may, in the cases referred to in subsection (1), numbers 1 and 2, and in subsection (3), withdraw the charges at any stage of the proceedings and terminate the proceedings if the conduct of proceedings poses the risk of serious detriment to the Federal Republic of Germany, or if other public interests of overriding importance present an obstacle to prosecution. (5) If criminal offences of the nature designated under section 74a subsection (1), numbers 2 to 6, and under section 120 subsection (1), numbers 2 to 7, of the Courts Constitution Act are the subject of the proceedings, such powers shall be vested in the Federal Public Prosecutor General.",Yes,"Germany's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 78th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2023) ... In July 2023, the Federal Ministry of Justice presented a draft bill on the advancement of international criminal law to further close impunity gaps and strengthen victims' rights in proceedings concerning international trials. Regarding procedural aspects, the paper suggests simplifying the cumulative representation of victims in courts, providing courtroom interpretations for foreign media, ensuring legal and psychological support for victims and allowing them to participate in trials as private plaintiffs. When it comes to reforming material aspects, the paper foresees changes in the crimes of sexualized violence, sexual slavery, forced abortion, as well as the prohibition of certain weapons of war in order to further align the CCAIL with the Rome Statute. ... Germany's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2022) ... Since 2002, German prosecutors can exercise universal jurisdiction under the Code of Crimes against International Law (Völkerstrafgesetzbuch - VStGB). Investigations and prosecutions can be initiated into genocide (§ 6 VStGB), crimes against humanity (§ 7 VStGB) and war crimes (§§ 8-12 VStGB). Cases currently heard by German courts deal with torture in Syrian prisons by the Syrian regime as well as crimes by members of Da’esh, including against the Yazidi community. While we would prefer to have the most serious crimes under international law tried by international tribunals, in particular the ICC if the applicable complementarity criteria are met, the Code of Crimes against International Law allows us to work towards accountability for these crimes on a national level. In March 2022, the Federal Public Prosecutor General initiated a structural investigation concerning war crimes committed in Ukraine in the context of the Russian war of aggression. This was later extended to crimes against humanity. It is currently gathering evidence, including statements by Ukrainian refugees. An additional specialized unit has been created within the Federal Public Prosecutor General to support these investigations. Many structural investigations have already led to trials and convictions in individual cases. In January 2022, the Higher Regional Court in Koblenz delivered the judgment against the main defendant regarding torture in a Syrian prison. It sentenced a senior officer of the General Syrian Intelligence Service in Damascus to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity. The defendant was found guilty of being the co-perpetrator of 27 murders and 4000 cases of severe deprivation of liberty. The crimes he committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Syria also include rape and sexual assault. In another case currently heard by the Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt, a Syrian doctor is accused of having committed crimes against humanity including torture and murder in Syrian prisons. Further trials and convictions concern persons associated with Da’esh, Jabhat al Nusra or other terrorist organisations in Syria or Iraq who have returned to Germany. In Germany, the competent authorities have implemented the concept of Cumulative Prosecution at an early stage. They hold Foreign Fighters accountable for war crimes, crimes against humanity or the crime of genocide, in addition to terrorism-related offences. Prosecuting terrorism offences combined with acts of core international crimes ensures the full criminal responsibility of perpetrators, may result in higher sentences, and delivers more adequate justice for victims and survivors. Several judgments have been delivered in relation to crimes committed against the Yazidi community. One of them concerned a former Iraqi member of Da’esh who was convicted by the Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt to a lifelong sentence for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes causing death. He and his wife, a German national, had abused a Yazidi woman and her daughter as slaves. His wife was convicted by the Higher Regional Court of Munich for aiding and abetting membership in a foreign terrorist organization, aiding and abetting murder by omission and crimes against humanity causing death. Another German woman was convicted by the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg for membership in a foreign terrorist organization, aiding and abetting genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. She had abused a Yazidi woman as a slave with her husband. The advantages of Cumulative Prosecution become particularly relevant for addressing acts of former members of Da’esh returning to Germany. German courts have found that several female returnees committed the war crime of appropriation of property (§ 9 VStGB) by occupying a flat from which victims of Da’esh had fled. In other cases, it was found that women committed the war crime of conscripting or enlisting children for handing over their own children to a Da’esh military training camp (§ 8 Abs. 1 Nr. 5 VStGB). In June and July, 2022, German Higher Regional Courts handed sentences of several years to three women for war crimes and membership in a terrorist organisation after their return from northeast Syria. German prosecutors are currently running over 100 investigations into international crimes. The message is clear: those who commit atrocities cannot feel safe. They will eventually be held accountable. There is no safe haven for perpetrators of international crimes against criminal prosecution in Germany. Justice will be served for the victims and survivors. Germany's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2021) ... Germany has found universal jurisdiction to be an effective and proportionate tool for pursuing accountability for the most serious crimes under international law. While it would be preferable for the Security Council to give the ICC more scope for trying the most serious crimes under international law, national jurisdictions can play an important part in achieving accountability. Cases regarding torture in Syrian prisons by the Syrian regime as well as crimes by members of Da’esh are currently being heard in German courts. Since 2002, German prosecutors can exercise universal jurisdiction under the Code for Crimes against International Law (Völkerstrafgesetzbuch – VStGB, ‘Code of Crimes against International Law’, CCAIL). Investigations and prosecutions can be initiated with regard to genocide (section 6 of the VStGB), crimes against humanity (section 7 of the VStGB) and war crimes (sections 8-12 of the VStGB). There are no material conditions to the applicability of universal jurisdiction for these crimes. The Code for Crimes against International Law also applies to crimes committed outside Germany, regardless of the nationality of the victim or perpetrator or any other connections to Germany (section 1 of the VStGB). German law does not provide for the criminal liability of companies or other legal persons. What is more, immunity under international law may need to be taken into account. In order to be tried before a German court, the defendant needs to be present in Germany. A trial in absentia is not envisaged in our legal system. However, prosecutors and police can commence preparatory investigations to preserve evidence and allow for a swift commencement of proper proceedings once the accused has entered Germany. Specialised units have been created within the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA) and the Federal Public Prosecutor General (Generalbundesanwalt) to investigate international crimes. The Federal Public Prosecutor General runs a number of structural investigations (“Strukturermittlungsverfahren”) to investigate the background of large-scale crimes. Structural investigations serve to gather and preserve evidence in preparation for future proceedings. Since 2011, the Federal Public Prosecutor General has been running such a structural investigation concerning crimes against humanity and war crimes regarding acts committed by members of the Syrian regime. The Federal Public Prosecutor General is also running a structural investigation of this nature concerning crimes against humanity and war crimes regarding acts committed in Syria and Iraq by members of Da’esh and other terrorist groups. These Structural investigations have led to several trials. A trial concerning crimes against humanity commenced on 23 April 2020 against two former members of the Syrian intelligence services. One of them is charged with overseeing the torture of more than 4000 persons. A significant number of the victims is presumed not to have survived the torture and sexual assaults in a prison close to Damascus. A German national is currently being tried for her alleged involvement in war crimes while she was a member of Da’esh, causing the death of a young Yazidi girl. A foreign national has been extradited to Germany to face charges of genocide for crimes committed against the Yazidi community in Iraq. Further trials and convictions concern persons associated with Da’esh in Syria or Iraq who have returned to Germany. As many of the individuals concerned have German nationality, these may not be cases of universal jurisdiction; however, they have led to interesting developments regarding the application of international criminal law. German courts have found that the occupation of a flat from which victims of Da’esh had fled can constitute the war crime of appropriation of property (section 9 of the VStGB).Furthermore, it was found that a mother committed the war crime of conscripting or enlisting children by handing her own child to a Da’esh military training camp (section 8 (1) 5 of the VStGB). German courts have also sentenced women who had fought with Da’esh in Syria for national crimes such as membership of a terrorist organization and violation of the duty of care towards their children as well as crimes under international law such as enslavement of a Yazidi woman (“cumulative prosecution”). Moreover, in an important ruling of 28 January 2021, the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH) explicitly established for the first time that an official of another state (an officer in a national army) is not entitled to functional immunity (or ratione materiae immunity) with regard to acts carried out within the scope of their duties before national, especially German criminal prosecution agencies or courts. This ruling reflects the customary practice of Germany’s Federal Public Prosecutor General for many years now. Applying the Federal Court of Justice ruling on ratione materiae immunity, on 24 February 2021 the Koblenz Higher Regional Court convicted the Syrian national Eyad A., a member of the Syrian General Intelligence Services, for complicity in crimes against humanity and sentenced him to four years and six months in prison. This was the world’s first court conviction in which an official of the Syrian regime was brought to justice for the regime’s actions against the opposition from late April 2011 onwards. The judges ruled that these actions should be deemed crimes against humanity (section 7 of the VStGB) and stressed that – irrespective of any mistreatment – imprisonment alone in the Syrian intelligence service department 251 constituted torture in view of the atrocious conditions there. German prosecutors are currently running over 100 investigations into international crimes. The message is clear: those who commit atrocities cannot feel safe. They will eventually be held accountable. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2019) ... The German Code of Crimes against International Law (CCAIL), which entered into force on 30 June 2002 (Federal Law Gazette I p. 2254), made sure that the most serious crimes against international law were also criminal offences under German law. These include genocide (section 6 of the CCAIL), crimes against humanity (section 7) and war crimes (sections 8 to 12) and, since 1 January 2017, the crime of aggression (section 13). The CCAIL only applies to criminal offences committed after it entered into force. Criminal offences committed before 30 June 2002 are dealt with in accordance with prior legislation. Responsibility for bringing prosecutions under the CCAIL lies, pursuant to sections 120 (1) 8 and 142a of the Courts Constitution Act, with the Federal Prosecutor General, unless he transfers the case to a Land public prosecution office under section 142a (2) 2 as a “case of lesser importance”. This applies if the case is less serious than the average criminal proceedings as regards the complexity of the proceedings, the severity of the crime or its significance to the perpetrator or the victim. The Federal Prosecutor General has to date transferred a total of four cases under the CCAIL to the Land public prosecution offices. These were all so-called “posing cases” brought under section 8 (1) 9 of the CCAIL, in which the accused posed for photos with the bodies or body parts of rival fighters. The first sentence of section 1 of the CCAIL states that the principle of unlimited universal jurisdiction applies to genocide (section 6), crimes against humanity (section 7) and war crimes (sections 8 to 12). However, crimes of aggression (section 13) only fall within the scope of application of the CCAIL if the offence bears a concrete relation to Germany (second sentence of section 1) Section 12 (1) of the German Criminal Code defines crimes as unlawful acts punishable by a minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment. That means that these unlawful acts are always subject to German criminal law, regardless of where they were committed or the nationality of the perpetrator. However, this general applicability of German criminal law does not automatically legitimise universal prosecution, especially when the suspect is not a German and the crime was not committed against a German national. Section 153f of the Code of Criminal Procedure therefore contains a differentiated set of circumstances under which a prosecution does not have to be brought. It assumes that bringing a prosecution is primarily the responsibility of the state in which a crime was committed or of the home countries of the perpetrator and victim, or of any competent international court. This view is justified by the special interest the home countries of the perpetrator and victim have in the prosecution, as well as by the fact that the jurisdictions with primary responsibility are, as a rule, better positioned to gather evidence. There are no legal restrictions resulting from the absence of the accused from the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany; this applies in particular to cases in which a German national is suspected of having committed a crime or a crime has been committed against a German national. ... Germany's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2014) ... On 3 June 2013 the Federal Republic of Germany was one of the first State Parties to the Rome Statute ratified the amendments on the crime of aggression to the Rome Statute, which had been adopted at the Review Conference of the Rome Statue, held in Kampala, Uganda, on 11 June 2010. Germany intends to implement the crime of aggression into national law until 2017. ... Germany's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2012) ... Germany opted for the implementation of the Rome Statute in two comprehensive and autonomous laws which entered into force on 1 July 2002, the same day as the Rome Statute: 1. the Code on International Criminal Law (Völkerstrafgesetzbuch, “VStGB”) of 26 June 2002, which implements the Rome Statute substantively, and 2. the ICC Cooperation Law (Gesetz über die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Internationalen Strafgerichtshof, “IStGHG”) of 21 June 2002, which creates new procedural law. The Code on International Criminal Law is translated into the six official UN languages and also into Greek and Portuguese. The German ICC Cooperation Law is translated into English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Russian. In addition, various provisions of pre-existing laws had to be changed, including article 16(2) of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz, GG - Basic Law) which enabled German authorities to surrender German nationals to the ICC. Several procedural laws were reformed by the ICC Implementation Act (Gesetz zur Ausführung des Römischen Statuts des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs, “IStGH- AusführungsG”) of 21 June 2002. More recently, the German Criminal Code has been complemented, in line with Germany’s obligation under article 70(4)(a) Rome Statute, with a clause that extends the German provisions on false testimony to such offences committed in proceedings before the ICC. The substantive crimes of articles 5-8 Rome Statute are incorporated into domestic law in §§ 6-12 of the Code on International Criminal Law (VStGB). ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... 2. Material Reach Universal jurisdiction means the jurisdiction to try crimes committed abroad irrespective of the law of the locality where the offence took place and of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim. According to Section 1 of the German Code of Crimes against International Law of 26 June 2002 (Volkerstrafgesetzbu.ch) this act shall apply to criminal offences designated therein even when the offence was committed abroad and bears no relation to Germany. The competent German Court of Appeal may exercise jurisdiction over the following serious criminal offences defined in the Code: a) genocide (section 6); b) crimes against humanity (section 7); c) war crimes against persons (section 8); cl) war crimes against private property and other rights (section 9); e) war crimes against humanitarian operations and emblems (section 10); f) war crimes concerning illegal methods of war (section 11); g) war crimes concerning illegal means of war (section 12); Furthermore, according to section 6 of the general Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) courts may exercise universal jurisdiction over various serious crimes, namely crimes involving nuclear energy, explosives or radiation, attacks against air or sea traffic, trafficking in human beings, unauthorised distribution of narcotics, dissemination of pornographic writings, counterfeiting, subsidy fraud, as well as other crimes committed abroad, if they must be prosecuted on the basis of a binding international agreement. 3. Procedural Issues Sections l53(c) and 153(f) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordmmg) provide 1 that public prosecutors have discretion with regard to the prosecution of crimes committed outside German territory. a) General Rule on Crimes Committed Abroad Section 153(c) para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that prosecutors may decide not to prosecute crimes which were committed outside the territorial scope of application of the Code of Criminal Procedure or which were committed by ,\n accessory to a crime which itself was committed outside the territorial scope of application (no. 1); crimes which were committed by a foreigner on a foreign ship or airplane within German territory (no. 2); when in the cases of the crimes of 'Building of Criminal Associations (section 129 Criminal Code) or of 'Building of terroristic Associations' (section 129a Criminal Code) the association does not, or does not mainly exist in Germany and the criminal act in question is of minor relevance or is limited tu mere membership (no. 3 ). Furthermore, according to sections 153(c) para. 2 and 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prosecutors may decide not to initiate a prosecution, if a sentence against the accused has already been executed abroad and a sentence in Germany would be of comparably minor relevance or 1f the accused has already been acquired abroad by a final judgment in respect of the offence (ss 2); the crime was committed within the territorial scope of the Code of Criminal Procedure but through an act which took place outside of this scope, provided the execution of the criminal procedure could be seriously detrimental for the Federal Republic of Germany or is in conflict with overwhelming public interests (ss 3). If, in the cases of sections 153(c) para. 1 no. 1, 2 and subsection 3, an indictment has already been submitted, prosecutors may suspend the court proceedings at any stage of a litigation, provided a continuation could be seriously detrimental to the Federal Republic of Germany or is in conflict with overwhelming public interests. b) Crimes under the Code of Crimes Against international Law Section 153(t) of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies to the prosecution of international crimes under the Code of Crimes Against: International Law. provided the conditions of section 153(c) para. 1 no. 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are met. Section 153(t) para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that prosecutors may decide not lo initiate criminal proceeding!;, if the accused is not present in Germany and a future presence is not lo be expected. If in the cases referred to in section 153 (c) para. l no. 1, the accused is a German, however, this shall only apply if the offence is being pursued by an international court or by a state on whose territory the offence was committed or a citizen of which was injured by the offence. Section 153(t) para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that prosecutors may in particular decide not. to prosecute, if: a) no German is suspected of having committed the crime; b) the offence has not been committed against a German; c) the accused is not present. in Germany or a presence is not to be expected; and d) the offence is pursued by an international court, by the state in which the offence was committed or by the state whose citizenship the suspect bears or a citizen of which was injured by the offence. The same applies, if the accused is present ln Germany, yet the conditions of b) and d) are met and the extradition to an international court or a state pursuing the case is permitted and intended.",The Federal Prosecutor General is the competent authority to prosecute crimes under the Act to Introduce the Code of Crimes against International Law.

Greece's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2013) ... The principle of universal jurisdiction is one of the traditional jurisdictional principles recognized in Greek criminal law. It should be stressed, however, that the scope of this principle is relatively limited. More specifically, Article 8 of the Greek Penal Code establishes the principle of universal jurisdiction for the following categories of crimes committed abroad, to the extent that it provides that Greek penal laws are applicable to nationals and foreigners alike irrespective of the laws of the country where the act was committed: a) high treason, treason against the Greek State and terrorist acts; b) crimes concerning military service and the obligation for conscription; c) punishable acts committed by persons in their capacity as civil servants of the Greek State;· d) acts against a Greek civi.I servant in the exercise of his/her duties or related to his/her duties; e) perjury in the context of proceedings pending before Greek authorities; f) piracy; g) crimes against the currency; h) slave-trade, trafficking in human beings, forced prostitution or sexual abuse of minors for profit, child sex tourism or child pornography; j) illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs; i) illegal circulation and trafficking in obscene publications; k) any other crime to which Greek penal laws apply by virtue of specific provisions or international conventions signed and ratified by Greece. National jurisdiction is exercised irrespective of the location of the crime and the nationality of the alleged victim or perpetrator, concurrently to the eventual jurisdiction of other States. Furthermore, no application by a foreign authority or complaint by the victim is necessary for the prosecution of the act. Art 8 has been applied by the Greek Courts mostly in cases pertaining to trafficking in narcotic drugs. Furthermore, Law 3658/2008 on ""Measures for the protection of cultural property and other provisions"" (Official Gazette, Vol. A' 70/22.4.2008) stipulates in Article 13 par. 4 that the offences provided for in Chapter 9 of Law 3028/2002 on the ""Protection of Antiquities and cultural heritage in general"" (Official Gazette, Vol. A' 153/28.6.2002) are prosecuted and punished according to Greek penal laws even if committed abroad. It should also be noted that Article 2 of Law 394812011 (Official Gazette, Vol. A' 71/5.4.2011) on the ""Adjustment of domestic law provisions to the provisions of the Statute of the International Criminal Court ratified by Law 3003/2002 (A' 75)"" provides that the provisions of this Law are applicable both to nationals and foreigners for all acts enumerated in Articles 7 to 15 (i.e. genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, violation of the duty of supervision, omission to report a. crime) provided that they have been committed: a) in the territory of the Greek State or on board Greek vessels or aircrafts, wherever they are present, unless they are subject to foreign legislation according to international law, b) abroad, by Greek nationals or foreigners who acquired the Greek nationality after the commission of the act, c) abroad, against the Greek State or Greek nationals.

Observations of Iraq on provisions on universal jurisdiction Iraqi legislation addresses the subject of universal jurisdiction and its implications for Iraqi jurisdiction in article 13 of the Penal Code (Act No. 111 of 1969), which provides that the Code’s provisions are applicable to any person present in Iraq who has committed or has been an accessory to a crime abroad involving sabotage or disruption of international means of communication and transportation, or trafficking in women, children, slaves or drugs. Article 14 of that same Code provides that prosecution of such offences in the Iraqi courts requires authorization from the President of the Supreme Judicial Council. The Code prohibits prosecution of the accused if there has been a final judgment of acquittal or conviction handed down by a foreign court and any sentence has been served in full, or if the proceeding or sentence has been vacated by law. In determining whether the judgment was final or the proceeding was vacated, reference shall be made to the law of the country where the judgment was handed down. If the penalty imposed was not fully implemented or the acquittal judgment was handed down for a crime to which Iraqi law is applicable owing to personal jurisdiction or protective jurisdiction and was a result of the the offence not being punishable under the law of that land, then legal proceedings may be brought against the accused in Iraqi courts. Iraq law does not specify which court is to conduct the preliminary investigation and trial. That determination is to be made by referral to the President of the Supreme Judicial Council. Iraq's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... The Penal Code of Iraq recognizes the principle of universal criminal jurisdiction and refers to it by the term ""comprehensive jurisdiction"". Article 13 of the Penal Code, act No. 111 (1969), provides that, other than situations in which Iraqi law is applicable in accordance with territorial or specific jurisdiction, universal jurisdiction applies to any person present in Iraq, regardless of nationality, who has committed or has been an accessory to a crime abroad of sabotage or disruption of international means of communication and transportation, or of trafficking in women, children, slaves or drugs. The scope of universal jurisdiction is restricted to the aforementioned offences and does not extend to any other crimes. Under Iraqi law, prosecution of offences that fall within the scope of universal jurisdiction requires the authorization of the Minister of Justice. The Penal Code, article 14, paragraph 1, provides that legal action may not be initiated against a person who has committed an offence outside the Republic without that authorization. Pursuant to article 53, paragraph (b), of the Code of Criminal Procedure, law No. 23 (1971), the investigation of such crimes is conducted by an investigating magistrate appointed by the Chief of the Higher Judicial Council. An offender may not be prosecuted if a definitive judgement of guilt or innocence has been pronounced by a foreign court, if a sentence has been served in full or if the conviction has been legally overturned. Issuance of a definitive judgement, cessation of prosecution and nullification of punishment are subject to the laws of the State that took such action. Pursuant to the Penal Code, article 14, paragraphs I and 2, legal action may be taken in the courts of the Republic of Iraq if the penalty for an offence that falls within the scope of universal jurisdiction has not been fully carried out or if the laws of the State in which the offence occurred do not criminalize that offence: Iraqi law does not require dual criminality in order to apply universal jurisdiction. Persons convicted of crimes that fall within the scope of universal jurisdiction are given credit for time served abroad, whether under arrest, in detention or in prison, for the crimes of which they have been convicted. ...",Public Prosecutors,Yes,"[Official Translation] Iraqi Penal Code (No. 111/1969) Paragraph 11 - This Code is not applicable to offences that are committed in Iraq by persons who benefit from statutory protection under the terms of international agreements or international or domestic law.

Ireland made a submission earlier this year to the Secretary-General setting out the offences in Irish law that rest of universal jurisdiction. Ireland considers that universal jurisdiction allows a State to assert jurisdiction over an offence irrespective of the place in which it was committed, the nationality of the accused, the nationality of the victim, or any other link with the prosecuting State. 5. The exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction of any type - including universal jurisdiction - is exceptional in Ireland. Our approach is framed by our constitution, which provides for the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction in accordance with the generally accepted principles of international law. Further, Irish domestic law does not allow for trials in absentia, so the exercise of universal jurisdiction - as with any other type of jurisdiction - requires the presence of the alleged perpetrator within the territory of Ireland. As such, the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction has remained very limited under Irish law to date. ... Ireland's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2010) ... Ireland ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on 11 April 2002. An amendment to the Irish Constitution was necessary before ratification, as becoming party to the Statute involved a partial transfer of the sovereign power of the State to administer justice. The amendment was effected by means of a referendum held in 2001 and adopted by an overwhelming majority of Irish voters. The amendment now forms Article 29.9 of the Irish Constitution, which provides that ""The State may ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court done on the 17th day of July, 1998.""

Various Israeli domestic laws provide for the application of jurisdiction over certain grave offences which have been recognized as crimes of universal concern, even when Israel’s only jurisdictional link to the crime is the presence of the alleged offender in Israel. For example: the Crime of Genocide (Prevention and Punishment) Law (1950) enables Israeli authorities to prosecute and try any person who has committed the crime of genocide; the Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law (1950) permits the assertion of criminal jurisdiction with regard to war crimes committed during the Second World War and crimes against humanity committed during the period of the Nazi regime; in addition, Israel’s Penal Law (1997), provides for the application of Israeli penal laws to those extraterritorial offences which Israel has undertaken to punish in accordance with multilateral conventions open to accession, even if the person committing the offence is not an Israeli citizen and irrespective of where the offence was committed. Israel notes that the principle of “extradite or prosecute” (also referred to as the principle of aut dedere aut judicare) is conceptually distinct from universal jurisdiction. Israel further notes that even in cases where States have the authority to assert universal jurisdiction, they have broad prosecutorial discretion in determining whether to do so in a specific case. This is increasingly reflected in State practice world-wide, where appropriate safeguards have been applied so as to ensure the careful and responsible exercise of the principle of universal jurisdiction and to prevent its abuse for political ends. Under Israeli law, the prosecution of extra-territorial offences (including on the basis of universal jurisdiction) may only be conducted by or with the written consent of the Attorney General, upon consideration that doing so is in the public interest (see Section 9(b) of the Israeli Penal Law (1977)). As clearly stated in the explanatory notes attached to the legislative proposal which introduced this provision in 1994, the requirement from the Attorney General’s prior consent was specifically intended to provide mechanism for careful filtering in matters where foreign relations implications and special evidentiary difficulties arise, and which necessarily require special discretion and oversight in the general interest of the public and the State. Israel’s legislation and judicial practice, similar to that of other states in the context of universal jurisdiction cases, have also accorded respect to additional principles of international law, such as due process guarantees including the avoidance of proceedings in absentia, as well as recognizing that universal jurisdiction is a mechanism of last resort, which should, as a matter of policy, respect the priority of States with primary jurisdictional links. ...","State Attorney.

Consequently, in the period 1999 to 2012, pending adoption of implementing legislation has not at any point in time hindered the full cooperation and judicial assistance by Italy to the ICC. In particular, Italy has actively answered to all requests for cooperation and assistance under the existing rogatory procedures (Code of Criminal Procedure, Articles 696 to 746). On several occasions, Italy has also provided to the ICC support that goes beyond the cooperation obligations under the Statute, and expands to political, diplomatic and material assistance. ... Italy's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... Italy exercises universal jurisdiction over crimes against international law. According to a broad provision in the Italian Criminal Code (article 7, 5 5), the foreigner that commits a crime abroad is punished under Italian law whenever this is provided for by special legislation, or by international conventions. Italy has pledged to co-operate in the suppression of all serious crimes by adopting multilateral conventions, bilateral and multilateral extradition treaties and treaties providing for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters ... Italy, Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... 1. Italian legislation establishes universal jurisdiction in criminal matters in three general provisions in the Criminal Code (Articles 7, 8 and 10 CC). These provisions arc contained in section one, book one, of the Criminal Code, devoted to general rules on the application of criminal law. 2. As is well known, at the international level universal jurisdiction has manifested itself in two main forms: ""Unconditional universal jurisdiction'', which entails, among other things, that prosecutions in absentia may occur; and ""conditional universal jurisdiction"", which requires the fulfillment of certain requirements to ensure reasonable exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction (e.g. the presence of the alleged offender in the territory of the state of the forum, or the prohibition of his or her extradition towards the territorial or national state, or the need for a specific request by the Minister of Justice and so on). 3. In Italy, Article 7 CC refers to the punishment of offences committed abroad (both by Italians as well as foreigners). It affirms jurisdiction over a set of offences against national interests, such as offences against the personality of the State, or counterfeiting of money or State symbols. In these cases foreigners can be prosecuted before Italian courts even if they committed the crime abroad. However, the rationale is not so much universal jurisdiction but the protection of Italian interests. Nonetheless Article 7(5) CC contains a broad provision which may be said to allow Italian courts to exercise universal jurisdiction unconditionally including over international crimes. According to Article 7(5) CC the foreigner that commits a crime abroad is punished under Italian law whenever this is provided for by special legislation, or by international conventions. Clearly, this is a 'blank' provision; its concrete content as well as the 'unconditional' or 'conditional' nature of universal jurisdiction under this rule will depend on the special provisions of Italian legislation or international conventions referred to. In sum, Article 7(5) CC allows for universal jurisdiction, but it is ultimately for the other provisions to which it refers to determine the actual scope of universal jurisdiction. A case by case analysis will then be necessary to determine whether or not there are specific rules providing for universal jurisdiction for any given offence as well as whether or not there are conditions limiting universality. Just as an illustration, it is worth noting that with regard to some international conventions ratified by Italy, it has been decided to adopt implementing legislation which specifies the limits of universal jurisdiction (e.g. Law n. 107, 25 March 1985 Art. 2, implementing the UN Convention on internationally protected persons, or Law n. 342 10 May 1976, Art 3, implementing various international conventions on terrorism against aircrafts), thereby opting for 'conditional' universal jurisdiction. Even for the implementation of the 1984 Convention against Torture it would seem that a choice was made to opt for the conditional version of universal jurisdiction (see Article 3, Law no. 498, 3 November 1988 on the ratification and execution of the Convention against Torture), requiring the presence of the defendant, the non-extradition and the request of the Minister of Justice. It is more controversial whether any conditions may be imposed to universal jurisdiction provided for by the grave breaches provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. In this case the solution would seem to be dependent upon the interpretation given to the principle of universality provided for by the provisions of the Conventions themselves. 4. Article 10 CC generally provides for conditional universal jurisdiction. Italian law applies to ordinary crimes committed abroad by foreigners. On the basis of this provision a foreigner who commits a crime against an Italian citizen (in this case, of course, it is not universal jurisdiction but jurisdiction under the passive nationality principle) or against a foreigner outside Italy, can be brought before Italian courts provided that several conditions are cumulatively met: i) First of all it must be an offence for which a minimum. sentence of three years is established. ii) Secondly, the alleged offender must be in Italy. iii) Thirdly, there must be the request of the Minister of Justice (or the complaint of the victim of the offence if this is required under Italian law). iv) Fourthly, no extradition may take place either because it is not granted or because it has not been requested. Hence, one may conclude that Article 10 CC contains the conditional version of universal jurisdiction. Foreigners who commit crimes abroad against can be punished under Italian law but only under strict circumstances. 5. Finally, there is a last general provision containing some elements of universal jurisdiction, even if in this case it seems that the true rationale of the provision is to be found in the need to protect the interests of the State. Article 8 establishes that where a foreigner commits a political offence abroad (implicitly against Italy) he or she may be brought before Italian courts if the Minister of Justice so requires. It is however doubtful that international crimes can be characterized as political offences under Article 8 CC.",Prosecutor,No,"[Official Translation] Constitution of the Italian Republic (1947, amended through 2012) Art. 90 The President of the Republic is not responsible for the actions performed in the exercise of presidential duties, except in the case of high treason or violation of the Constitution.

It is worthy of note however that the presence of the accused is a strict requirement for commencement of prosecution proceedings for offences committed by a foreigner abroad. ... Kenya's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2017) ... We have fully implemented the Rome Statute, in our domestic legal system. Kenya's judiciary is making plans to establish a specialized chamber within its High Court, to adjudicate over international and transnational crimes. Kenya wishes to seek the assistance of the Secretariat, in facilitating building of capacity of its judicial and security officers, in effectively handling domestic criminal matters falling under the Rome Statute, that may occur domestically. ... Kenya's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... With regard to Kenya, the enactment of the International Crimes Act Number 16 of 2008 was an acknowledgement that serious crimes do occur and should not go unaddressed. It is an Act of Parliament to make provision for the punishment of certain international crimes, namely genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and to enable Kenya to co-operate with the International Criminal Court established by the Rome Statute in the performance of its functions. Section 6 (1) provides: 6. (1) A person who, in Kenya or elsewhere, commits: (a) genocide; (b) a crime against humanity; or (c) a war crime, is guilty of an offence. Sub-section (4) then defines the crimes as follows: In this section: ""crime against humanity"" has the meaning ascribed to it in article 7 of the Rome Statute and includes an act defined as a crime against humanity in conventional international law or customary international law that is not otherwise dealt with in the Rome Statute or in this Act; ""genocide"" has the meaning ascribed to it in article 6 of the Rome statute; ""war crime"" has the meaning ascribed to it in paragraph 2 of article 8 of the Rome Statute."" Section 8 (2) then bestows competent jurisdiction on the High Court of Kenya. It provides that ""A trial authorised by this section to be conducted in Kenya shall be conducted in the High Court."" In terms of judicial practice, Kenya is yet to prosecute any person under this Act. With these three ingredients satisfied, it is evident that Kenya has set up the mechanisms for the appropriate handling of matters related to universal jurisdiction. The Rome statute grants the international bedrock that underpins the domestic enactment of the International Crimes Act and the engagement of the Judiciary to handle cases that offend humanity in general irrespective of their location or residence. ...",Public Prosectors,N/A,N/A,No,N/A,No,N/A,N/A,,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,

In this vein, the Republic of Korea has incorporated the principle of universal jurisdiction into domestic legislation by allowing prosecution of certain crimes that did not take place in its territory by foreign nationals. My delegation submitted the information and observations on the scope and application of universal jurisdiction to the OLA this spring for the first time, so I would like to take this opportunity to introduce our representative regulations today. The Criminal Act extends criminal liability under universal jurisdiction for crimes of trafficking in persons to implement the United Nations Convention against Transnational and Organized Crime by amending the Criminal Act in 2013. We enacted the Act on Punishment of Crimes under Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to implement the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2011. The Act on Punishment for Damaging Ships and Sea Structures, which was enacted to implement the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted universal jurisdiction in 2003. We also incorporated universal jurisdiction for the Act on Counter- terrorism for the Protection of Citizens and Public Security, which was enacted to implement the related resolutions of the United Nations Assembly and Security Council in 2016. The Republic of Korea continues to explore topics related to the practical application of universal jurisdiction and stands ready to contribute to further discussions on its nature, scope, and limits. Korea's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... The Korean Constitution states, in Article 6, paragraph 1, that duly concluded and promulgated treaties and generally recognized rules of international law shall have the same effect as the domestic laws of the Republic of Korea. Meanwhile, Korea's Criminal Code establishes its jurisdiction on the basis of the principles of territoriality, nationality and specially protected interests, rather than that of universality. However, the fact that the Criminal Code does not overtly stipulate the principle of universality should not prevent the Korean courts from exercising universal jurisdiction, since, in the eyes of the Constitution, treaties and customary international law incorporating universal jurisdiction have the same standing within Korea as Korean domestic law. 3. Universal Jurisdiction in Judicial Practice The Korean judiciary has rarely exercised universal jurisdiction but there is one prominent case which is said to be relevant with universal jurisdiction. In 1983, a group of Chinese hijacked a Chinese domestic aircraft in flight; after inflicting gunshot wounds on several flight attendants, they forced the plane to land at a regional Korean airport. The Korean Supreme Court ruled that, while jurisdiction primarily belongs to the state of the aircraft's registration, namely China, considering Articles 1, 3, 4 and 7 of the Convention for the Suppression of the Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, concluded in 1970, Korea could also claim concurrent jurisdiction since the hijacked aircraft landed on its territory. Therefore a domestic Special Criminal Law, the Aircraft Navigation Safety Act, was deemed applicable to foreign hijackers who had committed their crime abroad. This incident occurred outside Korean territory, and involved no Korean offenders or victims; Korea was unconcerned save for the fact that the hijacked plane happened to land on its territory. The defending lawyers argued that the Korean judiciary had no jurisdiction in this case since the crime did not invoke any of the jurisdictional principles stipulated in the Criminal Code, such as territoriality, nationality, or specially protected interest. However, the court maintained that Korea could indeed exercise jurisdiction, based on the Convention, and jailed the hijackers. Even though the court's ruling made no explicit mention of universal jurisdiction, it is obvious that this was the guiding principle which led the court to claim jurisdiction in this case. 4. Provisions within Korean Domestic Law Regarding the Exercise of Universal Jurisdiction The Korean Constitution does not require additional domestic laws to be made in order to implement any treaties to which Korea is a party and which incorporate the aut dedere aut judicare principle. However, laws designed to facilitate its implementation were legislated for some of the treaties, and they make clear the legal grounds on which the Korean government can prosecute and punish crimes committed by alien nationals outside its territory. The Act on Special Cases concerning the Prevention of Illegal Trafficking in Narcotics, the Act on Punishment for Damaging Ships and Sea Structures, and the Act on Prevention of Procuring Money for the Purpose of Threatening the Public are such examples. The latter two Acts stipulate that the foreign national(s) concerned be physically present in Korean territory for universal jurisdiction to be applicable. 1 Korea is a party to the Rome Statute, and has legislated domestic laws to implement it. The domestic laws state that the Korean government may prosecute foreign nationals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed outside Korea, should such persons be present in Korean territory.2 ...","Victims of crimes have the right to file accusations with investigative agencies in writing or verbally.

The Senate of the Supreme court of the Republic of Latvia has referred to ETJ. Stated that based on the personal principle and ETJ, citizens of the Republic of Latvia for a criminal offense committed on the territory of another country, regardless of whether it is or not recognized as criminal and punishable at the other country, can be held criminally liable on the territory of the Republic of Latvia in accordance with the Criminal Law. That's why citizens of the Republic of Latvia must obey the laws of their country, no matter what country they are in.

In this case it was stated that the Republic of Latvia has the right to prosecute a person for a criminal offense committed on the territory of the Republic of Estonia based on Latvian legislation and not international acts (Europe Convention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters), as ETJ of the Republic of Latvia can be established. That is why, in the case of ETJ, it is permissible to apply Latvian legislation and not only international legislation or the legislation of the country from which the person who has committed a criminal offense is transferred.

Riga District Court, March 11, 2021. Case No. 12812000908. https://manas.tiesas.lv/eTiesasMvc/nolemumi/pdf/488304.pdf
In court practice, the existence of a violation of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights ""on the inadmissibility of punishment without the law"" has also been considered, the connection with the first part of Article 4 of the Latvian Criminal Law (amendments through 2009). The court recognized that there was no violation of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because a citizen of the Republic of Latvia, in accordance with the first part of Article 4 of the Latvian Criminal Law, had the opportunity to foresee that for an offense committed on the territory of another country, he could be prosecuted in the Republic of Latvia in accordance with the Latvian Criminal Law, and the law the defendant must comply regardless of the country in which he is located.
Administrative district court, October 3, 2018, Case No. A420160115 https://manas.tiesas.lv/eTiesasMvc/nolemumi/pdf/363655.pdf.
The court of the Republic of Latvia has also evaluated the mechanism of recognition of criminal offenses between countries and related issues. Concluding that the determination and application of the concept of criminal punishment is within the competence of the state of the Republic of Latvia, which is not subject to the laws of other countries or the European Union. The current regulation provides detailed mechanisms for the recognition of criminal offenses between countries only for the purpose of executing a criminal sentence, including determining the procedure for equating criminal offenses committed in a foreign country to the one established in national legislation. The first part of Section 749 of the Latvian Law on Criminal Procedure determines that the execution of a sentence imposed in a foreign country in Latvia is an undisputed recognition of the validity and legality of this sentence and its execution in the same manner as if the sentence had been imposed in a criminal trial held in Latvia. On the other hand, the second part of Section 749 of the Latvian Law on Criminal Procedure provides that recognition of the validity and legality of a sentence imposed in a foreign country does not exclude its harmonization with the sanction provided for in the Criminal Law for the same offense. In addition, Article 751, Clause 4 of the Latvian Law on Criminal Procedure provides that a request for execution of a sentence imposed in a foreign country can be refused if the person convicted in a foreign country could not be punished for the same offense in accordance with the Criminal Law. Thus, recognition of a sentence in accordance with the procedure provided for in the Latvian Law on Criminal Procedure has the effect that the sentence imposed on a person in a foreign country is executed in Latvia. However, this does not mean that a foreign court decision not recognized in the specified procedure (for the purposes of its execution) does not have any legal consequences in another member state. On the contrary, it follows from the above-mentioned legal framework that any final decision of a criminal court finding guilt in a criminal offense must have equivalent legal consequences in another member state, and for this purpose both courts and competent state authorities must evaluate whether the relevant criminal offense can be recognized as such also in this Member State.",N/A,N/A,,,,

Lesotho,UN Member State,LSO,Africa,Yes,Yes,"[Original Text] The Penal Code Act, 2010 Part VI - Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity, and War Crimes 93. Genocide A person commits an offence of genocide if by his or her act or omission he or she commits any of the following acts with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, religious group or any other identifiable group - (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Government Notice No. 17 of 2012 Commentaries On The Penal Code Bill, 2010 Official Commentary: section 94 This offence incorporates the definition of genocide as reflected in the Statute in its entirety. The Rome Statute has adopted the definition word-for- word as it appears in the United Nations Convention for the Prevention and Repression of the Crime of Genocide of 1948. The offence is based on the commission of one or more of the acts listed in paragraphs (a) to (e) with the specific intent to eliminate the whole group or large numbers of the group. Where specific intent is lacking the acts may still be punishable for an offence amounting to crimes against humanity or war crimes. Therefore genocide cannot be committed by negligence. Knowledge of circumstances will usually be addressed in proving genocidal intent and this will be decided by the Court on a case-by-case basis. It is irrelevant how many people are actually killed. It can be one or more as long as the genocidal intent is present. The term ""destroy"" as it appears in the offence should be given a progressive dynamic interpretation. For example, a group could be destroyed by prohibiting its language, or relocating it from one area to another [3].

Government Notice No. 17 of 2012 Commentaries On The Penal Code Bill, 2010 Official Commentary: section 96 This offence, like the other two, incorporates the definition of war crime under the Statute in its entirety. War crimes have traditionally been defined as violations of the most fundamental laws and customs of war but the Statute is said to have developed international law in that it criminalises acts that have never in international law been codified, like war crimes committed during non-international armed conflict. The offence includes sexual and gender-based offences, conscription and enlistment of children under fifteen years of age and attacks against humanitarian personnel as war crimes. However, not all of serious violations of international humanitarian law committed during non-international conflict like international starvation of civilians are considered as war crimes under the Statute [4].

Article 7 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania establishes the principle of active national jurisdiction where citizens and permanent residents of Lithuania are criminally liable under the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania for the crimes committed abroad. Lithuanian Criminal Code also establishes universal jurisdiction under international treaties for certain crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes, trafficking in human beings, money laundering, terrorist activity, and several others, regardless of the citizenship and place of residence of the perpetrator or the territory where the crime has been committed. Thus, in case it emerges that a criminal act was committed in Lithuania, the question concerning the liability of a person could be decided taking into account the territorial principle of jurisdiction (Article 4 of the CC), and in case it emerges that a criminal act was committed by a national of the Republic of Lithuania or a person permanently residing in Lithuania, jurisdiction based on the principle of nationality should be applied (Article 5 of the CC). Generally, one of the preconditions for the application of the universal jurisdiction is that a person is punished in the State in which he or she in fact is present only in case he or she cannot be extradited or surrendered to the State that is the place of commission of a crime or to the international court. State in the territory of which a criminal act was committed or the State whose national committed a criminal act should be the first to use the right to punish the offender for international crime. Only in case the extradition or surrender of the offender from the place where he/she in fact is present is not possible, the execution of universal jurisdiction could be considered. It should be noted that according to the Statute of the International Criminal Court the jurisdiction of this court is only complementary. However, neither such a precondition nor priorities of jurisdiction are stipulated in Article 7 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania. It should be noted that Lithuanian legislation and case law foresees that the ratified international treaties have supremacy over the national law. The principle aut dedere aut judicare establishing the obligation of the State to extradite or judge is stipulated in a number of international treaties, while the norm established in Article 7 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania gives rise to a precondition for proper application of universal jurisdiction. Article 7 of the CC clearly lists criminal acts subject to the principle of universal jurisdiction. Given the questions arise from the interpretation of international legal acts and Lithuanian criminal laws adopted during their implementation, the national case law may be based on the interpretations provided in the decisions of international courts. In this respect, the case law of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Court of Justice should be noted. An analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights is essential to ensure compliance with Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, especially in cases concerning the application of this principle in the context of liability for crimes against humanity and war crimes (e. g. Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, judgment of 17 May 2010; Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, judgment of 19 September 2008; Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, judgment of 12 July 2007; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, judgment of22 March 2001; K.-H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, judgment of 22 March 2001; Polednova v. Czech Republic, no. 2615/10, decision of 21 June 2011; Kolk and Kislyiy v. Estonia, nos. 23052/04 and 24018/04, decision of 17 January 2006; Penart v. Estonia, no. 14685/04, decision of 24 January 2006; Papon v. France, no. 54210/00, decision of 15 November 2001). One more important aspect of execution of criminal liability for crimes against humanity based on the principle of universal jurisdiction is also the possibility to prosecute a perpetrator in absentia. It is worth mentioning that in Lithuania, such a possibility is enshrined in the norms of the Code of Criminal Procedure and is effectively implemented. ... Lithuania's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2012) ... The Republic of Lithuania signed on 10 December 1998 and on 12 May 2003 ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Substantive provisions of the Rome Statute were incorporated into the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania (the new code entered into force on 1 May 2003). The Republic of Lithuania signed on 25 May 2004 and ratified on 30 December 2004 the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court. ... Lithuania's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... Article 7 of Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter refed to as the CC) incorporates the so-called criminal law doctrine principle of universal state criminal jurisdiction. The essence of the said principle is that in seeking prosecution of the person, who committed a criminal act, the state establishes criminal liability for certain crimes, regardless of their citizenship and the place of residence of the persons committing such crimes as well as the place of commission of the criminal act and whether the act committed is subject to punishment under the laws of the place of commission of the crime. Such provisions are in place to facilitate criminal law measures to prevent international crimes, therefore taking that into account under Article 7 of CC the Republic of Lithuania applies the universal criminal jurisdiction principle only to the crimes specified in the international treaties of the Republic of Lithuania. It is worth mentioning that the rule that establishes the principle of universality determines that a person who committed one of the crimes listed in Article 7 is punished not according international treaties of the Republic of Lithuania, but on the ground of international treaties. This provision reveals a much wider approach which means that it is possible that CC determines criminal responsibility for a crime referring to the international treaty even if the Republic of Lithuania is not a party to the particular treaty. Moreover despite the fact that some conventions concerning crimes of international character do not determine a possibility while applying principle of universality to implement other state's criminal jurisdiction for crimes listed in the conventions for example, human trafficking, CC allows such possibility. Under the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 7 of CC universal state criminal jurisdiction principle is applied to the following crimes: genocide (Article 99 of CC), treatment of persons prohibited under international law (Article 100 of CC), killing of persons protected under. international law (Article 101 of CC), deportation of civilians of an occupied state or transfer of the civilian population of an occupying state (Article 102 of CC), causing bodily harm to, torture or other inhuman treatment of persons protected under international humanitarian law (Article 103 of CC), forcible use of civilians or prisoners of w in the armed forces of the enemy (Article 105 of CC), destruction of protected objects or plunder of national valuable property (Article 106 of CC), delay in repatriation of primers of war (Article 107 of CC), delay in release of interned civilians or impeding repatriation of ok civilians (Article 108 of CC), unlawful use of the emblem of the Red Cross, Red Crescent and the United National Organization or another univa88lly recognized emblem (sign) or designation (Article 109 of CC), aggression (Article 110 of CC), prohibited military attack (Article 111 of CC), use of prohibited means of warfare (Article 112 of CC), marauding (Article 113 of CC), Commander's negligent performance of his duty (Article 113) of CC). ... Under the provisions of paragraph 8 of Article 95 of CC there are no statute of limitations for crimes referred to in Articles 99-106 and 110-113 of CC (respectively also in paragraph 1 of Article 7 of CC). Under the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 3 of CC a criminal law establishing the criminality of an act, imposing a more severe penalty upon or otherwise aggravating legal circumstance of the person who has committed the criminal act shall have no retroactive effect. The provisions of this Code establishing liability for genocide (Article 99 of CC), treatment of persons prohibited under international law (Article 100 of CC), killing of persons protected under international law (Article I01 of CC), deportation of civilians of an occupied state or transfer of the civilian population of an occupying state (Article 102 of CC), causing bodily harm to, torture or other inhuman treatment of persons protected under international humanitarian law (Article 103 of CC), forcible use of civilians or prisoners of war in the armed forces of the enemy (Article 105 of CC), aggression (Article 110 of CC), prohibited military attack (Article 111 of CC), use of prohibited means of warfare (Article 112 of CC), Commander's negligent performance of his duty (Article 113 of CC) shall constitute an exception. ... The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and other legal acts pertaining to the criminal procedures provides for immunity of certain persons (members of the Seias, President of the Republic, members of the Government, candidates to Presidents of the Republic, members of the Seimas and municipality councils, judges of the Constitutional Court and other cow, personnel of diplomatic missions and consular establishments, etc.) against criminal jurisdiction. Under the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 4 of CC the issue of criminal liability of the persons who enjoy immunity from criminal jurisdiction under international legal norms and commit a criminal act in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania shall be decided in accordance with treaties of the Republic of Lithuania and CC. Under subparagraph 3, paragraph 1, Article 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter referred to as CCP) if a crime is committed by a person enjoying immunity from criminal jurisdiction under international legal norms or permission to prosecute the person from a competent institution is not obtained when such permission is obligatory under the laws, the criminal procedure may not be instituted, and, if instituted, must be terminated. Persons, who enjoy immunity from criminal jurisdiction under international legal norms, cannot be detained or arrested. Procedures specified in CCP can only be carried out with regard to such persons only upon obtaining their consent or under their request. The consent of such persons shall be obtained via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania (paragraph 3, Article 5 of CCP). Under the provisions of Article 4 of the CCP irrespective of the place, when the crime is committed, the criminal procedure in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania shall be conducted under CCP, unless an international treaty of the Republic of Lithuania specifies other terms. Under the provisions of Articles 166 and 169 of CCP pre-trial investigation, in case there is basis for initiation, shall be initiated under the general procedure, i.e. after receipt of a complaint, statement or notification about criminal acts or after a prosecutor or pre-trial investigation officer establish features of criminal acts themselves, the prosecutor or pre-trial investigation officer shall immediately initiate the pre-trial investigation.

Although the principle is said to extend (under international criminal laws) to the serious crimes of international concern i.e. war crimes, crime against humanity and genocide, it is found that the exercise of jurisdiction has been treaty or statutory based with treaty or statute-based defining of those crimes since the Nuremberg Tribunal to the International Criminal Court. It is also generally argued that the exercise of criminal jurisdiction of those international tribunals has been on the basis of the delegated authority of the States involved, victor or loser alike. 12. Nevertheless it is recognized that certain States enacted domestic law to claim extra-territorial jurisdiction over such crimes and premised the legality of such legislation on the basis of the principle of universal jurisdiction. 13. Malaysia however would only claim such jurisdiction on the basis of treaty obligations. Therefore the existence of such obligation to apply universal jurisdiction over those offences would need to first be established by a treaty to which Malaysia has become a party. 14. Further thereto, Malaysia is of the view that it is not likely for the principle of universal jurisdiction to apply to any of the other offences such as terrorism or drug-trafficking unless the obligation to take jurisdiction absent nexus is established by the relevant treaties. ...

(b) Accomplice Liability. A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if, acting with the culpability required for the commission of the offense: (1) he knowingly aids such other person, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating commission of the offense; or (2) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity. (c) Exceptions to Accomplice Liability. Unless otherwise provided by the Code or by the law defining the offense, a person is not an accomplice in an offense committed by another person if: (1) he is a victim of that offense; or (2) the offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incident to its commission; or (3) he terminates his complicity prior to the commission of the offense and: (A) wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense, or (B) gives timely warning to the law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense. (d) Grading of Accomplice Liability. If the accomplice’s role in the commission of the offense is that of: (1) an organizer or leader, the grade of his liability is the grade of the offense aided; (2) a participant, the grade of his liability is one grade lower than that of the offense aided; (3) a minor participant, the grade of his liability is two grades lower than that of the offense aided. (4) Definitions. For the purposes of this Section: (A) an “organizer” or “leader” means an accomplice who exercises supervisory or managerial responsibility for or control over other accomplices. (B) a “minor participant” means an accomplice who provides minimal assistance or assistance that is either incidental to or not necessary for the success of the offense. (C) a “participant” means an accomplice whose role in the commission of the offense is less than that of an organizer or leader but more than that of a minor participant. (e) Complicity in Uncommitted Offense. A person who would have been accountable for the offense conduct of another person under Subsection (a) if the other person had committed the offense is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense. (f) Attempted Complicity. A person who attempts to aid another person in the commission of an offense under Subsection (b) is liable at one grade level lower than he would have been had his attempt succeeded, whether or not the offense is attempted or committed by the other person. (g) Accountability Despite Legal Incapacity. A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular offense himself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing his incapacity. (h) Unconvictable Perpetrator. An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the offense, and of his complicity therein, though the person claimed to have committed the offense: (1) has not been prosecuted or convicted, or (2) has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense, or (3) has an immunity to prosecution or conviction, or (4) has been acquitted.",Yes (ratification or accession),No,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"[Official Translation] Law No. 6/2014 Penal Code of the Maldives Section 13 Jurisdiction (a) Statement of Jurisdiction.

(b) Jurisdiction Not an Element of an Offense. Establishing jurisdiction is a prerequisite to prosecution and not an element of an offense. The prosecution need not prove the culpability of the defendant as to any of the criteria for jurisdiction. (c) Power of the Court. This Section does not affect the power of a court to punish for contempt or to employ any sanction authorized by law for the enforcement of an order or civil judgment. (d) Claims for Extradition.

This principle constitutes a fundamental tool for ensuring and guaranteeing the repression of serious violations of international law, since crimes continue to be perpetrated frequently by terrorist and drug-trafficking groups, particularly in my country, Mali. My country has incorporated universal jurisdiction into its domestic law, notably in Articles 29 [crimes against humanity] and 32 [imprescribability] of the Criminal Code of 2001, Article 24 [foreigners committing offenses against the State outside of Mali] of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2013 and Articles 16 and 17 of the Anti-Trafficking Act of 2012 of persons and the smuggling of migrants.

The Statute was implemented through the enactment of a specific Act entitled the International Criminal Court Act, Chapter 453, Laws of Malta which addresses the provision of legal assistance to the ICC to implement Part 9. Amendments were also made to the Criminal Code, the Extradition Act and the Prisons Act. Moreover in 2011, the Application of Part III of the Diplomatic Immunities and I of the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act (International Criminal Court) Order, 2011, were enacted through Legal Notice. The Criminal Code, Chapter 9, Laws of Malta, witnessed the introduction of a new Title which deals with Genocide, War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. The relevant articles, 54A-541, deal inter alia with jurisdiction, non-applicability of rules of prescription, responsibility of commanding officers and superiors, the requisite mental element and the protection of witnesses and victims. 7 (a) and (b). The Extradition Act, Chapter 276, Laws of Malta, saw the introduction of Part VI (Articles 26A-26U) which deals with the surrender of offenders to the International Criminal Court, thus implementing provisions in Part 9 dealing with extradition. ... Malta's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2010) ... Remark on relevant applicable international treaties The Geneva Conventions of 1949 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948) Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (1984) Universal jurisdiction may be exercised against a person accused or convicted of committing a serious crime under international law ( crimes against humanity; crimes against peace; genocide; piracy; slavery; torture; and war crimes). International legal instruments dedicated to serious crimes under international law often retain a legal obligation calling upon parties to ensure the maximum level of compliance. Information on domestic legal rules The grounds vesting the Maltese courts with jurisdiction are primarily found under Article 5 of the Criminal Code (Cap, 9). This Article incorporates a number of different theories on jurisdiction namely: purely territorial Article 5(1) (a); extension of the territoriality principle Article 5(1) (b); variants of the cosmopolitan theory Articles 5(1) (e) and 5(1) (g); the personal theory Article 5(1) (d) and the theory of self-preservation Article 5(1) (d). In transposing into national law, international agreements / instruments, Malta has further extended those grounds wherein the local courts can also exercise their jurisdiction. These grounds are also contemplated in the Criminal Code (Cap. 9) under the following Articles: Article 121C; Article 208B (5); Article 211 (3); Article 220 (3); Article 248E (5); Article 310B; Article 328M. To these must also be added the grounds where the Maltese Courts exercise the universality principle of jurisdiction, namely crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. These offences are found under articles 54A-I of the Criminal Code. Article 54G also has relevance in this context: ""54G. Without prejudice to the provisions of article 5, a criminal action for an offence under this Title may also be prosecuted in Malta - (a) against any person subject to military law in terms of articles 178, 179 and 180 of the Malta Armed Forces Act even if the offence was committed outside Malta; or (b) against any citizen of Malta or permanent resident in Malta who outside Malta conspires to commit any offence under this Title even if the offence is to be committed outside Malta.''. In terms of this latter provision a Maltese citizen or permanent resident would also be subject to Maltese jurisdiction if he conspires to commit such a crime notwithstanding that the conspiracy or the crime being conspired takes place outside Maltese jurisdiction. Malta has implemented this obligation commonly known as 'aut dedere aut judicare' through a combined reading of articles 5 and 54A of the Criminal Code, supplemented by Part VI of the Extradition Act. In fact article 5(1)(d) of the Criminal Code sanctions crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity (Article 54A, Criminal Code offences) when these are committed by a Maltese national or permanent resident, """"5.

Moreover in terms of Part VI of the Extradition Act, Chapter 276 of the Laws of Malta, since Malta is a party to the Statute of the International Criminal Court, Rome, 17th July, 1998, the arrest and surrender of a person alleged to have committed a crime over which the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction, or of a person alleged to have been convicted by the International Criminal Court is regulated.

The Republic of Moldova is party to a number of international treaties that allow the national courts to charge/judge the persons who have committed crimes under international law (e.g. the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 as well as the three additional Protocols from 1977 and 2005). The principle of universal jurisdiction is reflected in the legislation of the Republic of Moldova, in particular in art. 11, paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code which stipulates as follows: ""Foreign citizens and stateless persons without permanent domiciles on the territory of the Republic of Moldova who commit crimes outside the territory of the Republic of Moldova shall be criminally liable under this Code and shall be subject to criminal liability on the territory of the Republic of Moldova provided that the crimes committed are adverse to the [...] peace and security of humanity, or constitute war crimes including crimes set forth in the international treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is a party, if these persons have not been convicted in a foreign state. Furthermore, crimes under international law set forth in the international treaties are also reflected under the special part of that National Criminal Code, as follows: Chapter I ""Crimes against mankind's peace and security, war crimes"" (e.g. Genocide- art.l35 Criminal Code; The crime against humanity - art.135/1 Criminal Code; Ecocide - art.l36 Criminal Code; Inhumane treatment - art.l3 7 Criminal Code; War crimes against property and other rights - art.137i Criminal Code; Use of Forbidden Means of warfare- Art.l372 Criminal Code; Use of prohibited methods of warfare - art.13 7 3 Criminal Code; Use without permission of the distinctive signs of international humanitarian law - art.13 74 Criminal Code;); Chapter II ""Crimes against the freedom, honor and dignity of a person""; Chapter IX ""Environmental Crimes""; Chapter XI ""Computer crimes and crimes in the telecommunication sphere""; Chapter XIII ""Crimes against public security and public order""; Chapter XVII ""Crimes against public authorities and State security"", Chapter XVIII ""Military crimes"". ... Moldova's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2014) ... The Republic of Moldova has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (""the Statute"") in 2010. The Republic of Moldova has no obstacles to fully implement the Statute. (b) There are no specific strategies or plans of action concerning ratification and full implementation of the Statute. Nevertheless, the additional upcoming measures concerning full implementation of the Statute are part of the national action plans and institutional agendas. Full support of the ICC and the implementation of the Statute and its related instruments is one of the obligations within the Moldova-EU Association Agreement and National Plan on its implementation. The ratification by the Republic of Moldova of the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court is incorporated in the National Action Plan on Human Rights for 2011-2014. Accordingly, all actions preceding the ratification are included in the 2014 Action Plan of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Moldova. These actions contain as well a feasibility study concerning the amendments of the national legislation in accordance with the Agreement. The implementing legislation incorporates the substantive crimes under the ICC jurisdiction into domestic law without reference to the Statute. The crimes are incorporated into Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova, Articles 135, 135', 137-1374 as follows: - crime of genocide (Article 135); crimes against humanity (Article 1351) that incorporates the provisions of Article 7 of the Statute and other international treaties; it is followed by war crimes articles, divided in several categories (Articles 137-1374): war crimes against persons (Article 137); war crimes against property and other rights (Article 137'); use of prohibited means of warfare (Article 1372); use of prohibited methods of warfare (Article 1373); illegal use of the distinctive emblems of international humanitarian law (Article 1374). ... Moldova's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2013) ... In the Republic of Moldova (RM) the principle of universal jurisdiction is regulated by the article 11, paragraph 3 of its Penal Code (PC) which stipulates: ""If not convicted in a foreign state, foreign citizens and stateless persons without permanent residence on the territory of the Republic of Moldova who commit crimes outside the territory of the Republic shall be criminally liable under this Code and shall be subject to criminal liability on the territory of the Republic of Moldova provided that the crimes committed are adverse to the interests of the Republic of Moldova or to the peace and security of humanity, or constitute war crimes including crimes set forth in the international treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is a party. Concerning the application of the abovementioned principle, the PC of the RM in art. 2, para. 1 expressly states that ""Criminal law protects persons from crimes; person's rights and freedoms; property; the environment; constitutional order; the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova; the peace and security of humanity as well as the rule of law in its entirety."" The provision referring to the crimes against peace and security of humanity and war crimes are listed in the Special Part of the PC, art. 135-144. As regard to the prescription of criminal liability, pursuant to art. 60, para. 8 of the PC ""The limitation period shall not apply to persons who commit crimes against the peace and security of humanity, war crimes, or other crimes set forth in international treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is a party."" In case there are any discrepancies with international acts on fundamental human rights, the international regulations shall take precedent and be applied directly (art. 1, para. 3 of the PC of the RM). In this context, the international documents related to the principle of universal jurisdiction that RM acceded to are mentioned below: - Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto; - Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948; - Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotrophic Substances, 1988; - Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, 1990; - European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, 1977; - Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 1997 and other international legal restrictions on the use of certain methods and means in the conduct of hostilities. In order to ensure the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction to persons who commit crimes, the constitutive elements of crime stipulated in international treaties that Republic of Moldova acceded to have been introduced into the domestic criminal law. However, even though the Republic of Moldova ratified the Rome Statute (Law no. 202 of 9 September 2010), not all the crimes provided in the Statute are criminalized under the domestic legislation. Therefore, the Law no. 45 of 7 February 2013 amending the PC has been adopted by the Parliament of RM in the second lecture on 4 April 2014. The amendments refer to: - Art. 127 - Persons protected by the international humanitarian law; - Art. 130 - Mercenaries; - Art. 135 - Genocide; - Art. 135^1 - Crimes against humanity; - Art. 137 - War crimes against humanity; - Art. 137^1 War crimes against property and other rights; - Art. 137^2 - Use of prohibited means in the conduct of war; - Art. 137^3 - Use of prohibited methods in the conduct of war; - Art. 137^4 - Unlawful use of distinctive international humanitarian law signs. Regarding the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction, according to the existing data, currently there is no domestic judicial practice in this respect.

For the Netherlands, the most relevant piece of legislation concerning universal jurisdiction is the International Crimes Act of 19 June 2003, which entered into force in October 2003. This act replaced several pieces of legislation on genocide, war crimes and torture. In addition, the 2003 International Crimes Act codified crimes against humanity in Dutch national law. One of the main aims of the adoption of the International Crimes Act was the full implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Article 2 of the International Crimes Act states that, without prejudice to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and the Code of Military Law, Dutch criminal law shall apply to: a) anyone who commits any of the crimes defined in this Act outside the Netherlands, if the suspect is present in the Netherlands; b) anyone who commits any of the crimes defined in this Act outside the Netherlands, if the crime is committed against a Dutch national; c) a Dutch national who commits any of the crimes defined in this Act outside the Netherlands. In terms of providing a basis for the exercise of universal jurisdiction by the Netherlands, the first element is the most relevant part, as it allows the authorities to investigate and prosecute the crimes covered by the International Crimes Act when these have been committed abroad by foreign nationals. However, the International Crimes Act does not provide for full, unlimited jurisdiction in respect of international crimes. The judicial authorities of the Netherlands cannot open an investigation into alleged international crimes committed abroad by foreigners against non-nationals without the suspect having been identified and present in the country. Investigations into a general situation are not possible, unless the victim(s) and/or the alleged perpetrator(s) are Dutch nationals. In other cases, Dutch authorities are therefore only competent to investigate universal jurisdiction cases if the suspect is present on the territory during the investigation. In addition to the International Crimes Act, the Netherlands Criminal Code provides a basis for the exercise of universal jurisdiction by the Netherlands over the crime of piracy committed on the high seas. Dutch law does not require that the conduct under investigation or prosecution is also criminalized in the State of nationality of the suspect, or in the State in which the crime was committed. Hence, double criminality is not a prerequisite for the investigation or prosecution of international crimes. Netherlands' Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2021) ... For the Netherlands, the most relevant piece of legislation in respect of universal jurisdiction is the International Crimes Act of 19 June 2003, which entered into force in October 2003. This act replaced several pieces of legislation on genocide, war crimes and torture, including the Dutch Genocide Convention Implementation Act (“Uitvoeringswet genocideverdrag”) and the Dutch Torture Convention Implementation Act (“Uitvoeringswet folteringverdrag”). It also replaced several clauses of the Dutch Criminal Law in Wartime Act (“Wet oorlogsstrafrecht”). In addition, the 2003 International Crimes Act (“Wet internationale misdrijven”) codified the criminalization of crimes against humanity in Dutch national law. One of the main aims of the adoption of the International Crimes Act was the full implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which the Netherlands ratified on 17 July 2001 and which entered into force on 1 July 2002. Article 2 of the International Crimes Act states that, without prejudice to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and the Code of Military Law, Dutch criminal law shall apply to: a. anyone who commits any of the crimes defined in this Act outside the Netherlands, if the suspect is present in the Netherlands; b. anyone who commits any of the crimes defined in this Act outside the Netherlands, if the crime is committed against a Dutch national; c. a Dutch national who commits any of the crimes defined in this Act outside the Netherlands.

Investigations into a general situation are not possible, unless the victim(s) and/or the alleged perpetrator(s) are Dutch nationals (Article 2). In other cases, Dutch authorities are therefore only competent to investigate universal jurisdiction cases if the suspect is present on the territory during the investigation. In such cases, the decision to investigate and prosecute is based on a decision by the public prosecutor’s office. Dutch law does not require that the conduct under investigation or prosecution is also criminalized in the State of nationality of the suspect, or in the State in which the crime was committed. Hence, double criminality is not a prerequisite for the investigation or prosecution of international crimes. In terms of its material scope of application, the International Crimes Act criminalizes genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression based on the provisions of the Rome Statute, while taking into account relevant amendments to the latter. In addition to the Rome Statute, the International Crimes Act criminalizes torture (Article 8) and enforced disappearance (Article 8a) and aggression (Article 8c) as a stand-alone crimes in order to implement the obligations of the Netherlands under the Convention against Torture and the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance. In the past 20 years, the Netherlands has invested a significant amount of resources in the investigation and prosecution of individuals suspected of having committed core international crimes. Special teams within the national police service and the prosecution service have undertaken highly complex investigations, which have led to a significant number of convictions and important steps in the development of relevant case law. An overview of these cases can be found at www.warcrimes.nl. In addition to the International Crimes Act, the Netherlands Criminal Code (Article 381) provides a basis for the exercise of universal jurisdiction by the Netherlands over the crime of piracy committed on the high seas. Prosecutions based on this provision have also led to a number of convictions since 2010. ... Netherlands' Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2017) ... The implementation of the Statute was split in two parts: (1) legislation concerning legal assistance and other forms of cooperation that the Netherlands, as a state party and as the host country, is required to give to the Court (Implementation Act International Criminal Court); and (2) legislation ensuring that the crimes contained in the Statute were also criminalized in NL (International Crimes Act). Both Acts constitute separate, stand-alone legislation, but there are connections and links with pre-existing law. The International Crimes Act incorporates the substantive crimes of the Statute by incorporating these crimes into domestic law. The Netherlands has ratified the Kampala amendments. Consequently, the International Crimes Act is amended accordingly.","Filing of a complaint: Anyone with knowledge of a criminal offence can file a complaint with the Public Prosecutor, without necessarily being a victim of that offence. The person or entity filing the complaint does not have to become an Injured Party to the criminal proceedings. A complaint can be filed against an unknown suspect, who can be a natural or a legal person. It is very rare that investigations are actually opened after a complaint is filed, most investigations have been opened by the DDPS proprio motu. Initiate proceedings: According to Article 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Public Prosecutor has the exclusive right to initiate proceedings. This is the so-called “Opportuniteitsbeginsel” (The Principle of Opportunity). Right of the victim to proceedings: As previously stated the Public Prosecutor has, as a matter of principle, the exclusive right to start proceedings. However, based on Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, victims (and possibly other interested parties) can file a complaint with the Court of Appels if the Public Prosecutor decides not to initiate legal proceedings. If the Court of Appeals decides the complaint is legitimate, it can order the Public Prosecutor to initiate proceedings. Bringing a claim: A victim can have a role within Dutch criminal proceedings, although this role is limited. Victims are participants, but not an official party to the proceeding. At trial, a victim may apply to be admitted to the criminal proceedings, based on Article 51f of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as a so-called Injured Party to claim damages for financial loss, physical or psychological damages. Since 2018, families of the victims can also apply for damages.

Norway's new Penal Code of 2005 entered into force on 1 October this year. To a large extent, the new law continues the tradition of the previous Code of 1902. The new code does not provide a specific list of crimes over which universal jurisdiction is to be exercised. Rather, it allows for discretionary universal jurisdiction when the alleged offender is present on Norwegian territory, the law prescribes a sentence of more than one year imprisonment and - except in cases relating to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide - the act represents an offence also in the State where it was committed. In addition, two further requirements must be satisfied: First, the concrete application of the principle of universal jurisdiction must be consistent with international law. Second, the prosecuting authorities must retain the ability to exercise full discretion in its application of the principle of universal jurisdiction. According to the preparatory work of the new penal code, the main purpose of the Norwegian legislation relating to universal jurisdiction is to ensure that Norway does not become a safe haven for individuals wishing to avoid criminal responsibility for serious crimes. However, it is also underlined that not all cases that meet the criteria for universal jurisdiction should be prosecuted before Norwegian courts. Save for cases related to genocide and crimes against humanity, the prosecutor shall make his or her independent determination taking into account the gravity of the crime in question and the connection between the alleged offender and Norway, including whether the crime affects Norwegian interests. If the alleged offender could be extradited to another State that might hold a stronger legal interest or be better placed in proceeding with the prosecution these are also element of relevance. Furthermore, we have put in place robust control mechanisms guaranteeing the consideration of all relevant factors before universal jurisdiction is applied. The law does not open for any external interference, political or otherwise, into the deliberations made within the realm of independent prosecutors. ...","Anybody can report an offence, but only the public prosecutor has the standing to bring the claim to a court.

[Commentary to the Articles Articles 443 to 454 of the Criminal Code refer to war crimes |163|, which are punishable conducts that are executed against persons or goods protected by International Humanitarian Law. The criminalization of this type of behavior is due to the obligation contracted by the States Parties when ratifying these international instruments, in the sense of punishing serious violations of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. Additionally, the Rome Statute also criminalizes other war crimes that do not necessarily constitute a serious violation under the terms of the Geneva Conventions or Additional Protocol I. On the other hand, several international humanitarian law treaties establish the explicit obligation to do so, however, it would take too long to list them. The important thing to highlight in this type of crime is that they must occur in the context of an armed conflict, which presupposes the use of military force between two or more actors, whether they are state or not, and without going into whether it is an international or non-international armed conflict. It is worth making the distinction that the belligerent non-state actors must be irregular groups that have taken up arms, with the capacity to maintain intensity in the conflict and with a certain level of organization, which excludes common criminal groups. In examining war crimes, one must also consider the relationship between the armed conflict and the individual crimes, that is, there must be an obvious connection between the war crime itself and the armed conflict as a whole, for it to be configure this criminal type.]",Yes,"[Unofficial Translation] Criminal Code (2008) Article 441.

On 7 October 1998 Paraguay signed the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), known as the Rome Statute; it was enacted, in accordance with its internal legislation,4 by Act No 1663/2001, and the corresponding instrument of ratification was deposited on 14 May 2001. Act No 5877, “On the implementation of the Rome Statute which creates the International Criminal Court”, is currently in force. Through this Act, which was enacted on 28 September 2017, the Republic of Paraguay strengthened its cooperation with the ICC as well as its commitment to fostering the universality and full implementation of the Rome Statute. A copy of the referenced legislation is provided as an attachment to this report. On the other hand, it should be noted that the Kampala Amendments to the Rome Statute, which were transmitted to the National Congress through the Executive Power’s Message No 647/2017, were approved by Act No 6269 of 12 December 2018, enacted on 13 February 2019. This event is a new milestone in the promotion of universality of the ICC’s jurisdiction. Paraguay's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2020) ... 3. The Paraguayan Penal Code enshrines precepts consistent with the principle of universal jurisdiction, by extending the jurisdiction of national courts to punishable acts committed abroad against legal assets with protection universal, and by virtue of the obligation derived from an international treaty of which Paraguay is a party. 4. For Paraguay, universal jurisdiction, inspired by the principles of complementarity and good faith, represents a fundamental bulwark to promote the full validity of justice and thus avoid impunity for the perpetrators of serious crimes against humanity and systematic violations of human rights. 5. Our country is part of the Rome Statute, as well as the amendments of Kampala. In this sense, Paraguay has a law implementing of the Rome Statute, which typifies and establishes the expectation of penalties for crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, distinguishes national jurisdiction and universal jurisdiction and establishes the limitations of national jurisdiction. ... Paraguay's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2019) ... Our country is part of the Rome Statute and approved by Law of the Nation its adherence to the Kampala Amendment. In this sense, the national implementation law of the Rome Statute, typifies and establishes the expectation of penalties for crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, distinguishes between national jurisdiction and universal jurisdiction and establishes limitations of national jurisdiction. Likewise, the Paraguayan Penal Code is expressed in accordance with the principles of the universal jurisdiction extending the scope of the Paraguayan criminal jurisdiction to the facts carried out abroad against Paraguayan legal assets and legal assets of protection universal. It also contemplates cases in which the offender has Paraguayan nationality or, lacking it, he would be in the national territory and his extradition would have been rejected. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... The principle of universal jurisdiction has also been incorporated into our country's domestic law. Article 8 of the Penal Code reads: Offences committed abroad against legal assets enjoying universal protection 1. Paraguayan criminal law shall also apply to the following offences committed abroad: (a) Offences involving explosives, covered by article 203, paragraph 1 (2); (b) Attacks on civilian air and sea traffic as defined in article 213; (c) Trafficking in persons, covered by article 129; (d) Illicit trafficking in narcotics and hazardous drugs, covered by Act No. 1.350/88, articles 37 to 45; (e) Counterfeiting of currency or shares as defined in articles 264 to 268; (f) Genocide, covered by article 319; and (g) Offences that the Republic is required to prosecute under an international treaty currently in force, even where committed abroad. 2. Paraguayan criminal law shall apply only where the perpetrator has entered the national territory. 3. Prosecution under Paraguayan criminal law is prohibited where a foreign court: (a) Has acquitted the person in question; or (b) Has sentenced the person in question to a term of imprisonment and the sentence has been served or suspended or the person has been pardoned. In addition, article 9 of the Penal Code reads: Other offences committed abroad 1. Paraguayan criminal law shall only apply to other offences committed abroad where: (a) The offence is criminalized in the place of commission; and (b) At the time of commission, the perpetrator: (i) Held Paraguayan nationality or acquired it after the offence was committed; or (ii) Is not a Paraguayan national but is present in Paraguay and extradition has been refused even though the nature of the offence would have made it legally permissible. This shall also apply where there is no provision for punishment in the place of commission. 2. The provisions of article 5, paragraph 2, shall also apply in such cases. 3. The sentence may not be more severe than that envisaged under the legislation in force in the place of commission. It is clear from the above that in such cases, Paraguayan criminal law applies to offences described in the aforementioned article and committed outside of Paraguay, provided that the perpetrator has entered Paraguay and has not been convicted or acquitted by a court of the State in which the offence was committed. ... Paraguay's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2010) ... The Republic of Paraguay signed the Rome Statute on 7 October 1998, following which it was incorporated into national law by Law No. 1.663 dated 17 April 2001, and deposited with the Secretary- General of the United Nations on 14 May 2001. From a legal perspective there could not be said to be any obstacles, although the National Law for Implementation of the Statute has yet to be adopted; it is currently in the final stages of review by an inter-institutional commission constituted for that purpose and composed of representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Office of the Public Prosecutor, Ministry of Justice and Labour, Ministry of National Defence and Supreme Court of Justice, with the participation of non-governmental organisations for the protection of human rights. Once the Draft Law has been adopted, and while it is being considered by the National Congress, one of the issues to be examined will be the need to raise awareness in all relevant sectors, at both government and civil society level, regarding the scope of, and necessity for, specific national legislation that will enable compliance with the provisions of the Rome Statute in accordance with the principles of complementarity and cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Performance of this task will be governed by the economic resources made available by the State of Paraguay in order for the work to be carried out to the requisite technical standard and with the quality that it merits.","Public Prosecutors [Unofficial Translation] Law Implementing the Rome Statute creating the International Criminal Court (Law No. 588 of 2017) Article 6.- National jurisdiction and universal jurisdiction.

First, universal jurisdiction, as a generally accepted principle of international law, is considered part of Philippine law, both through the incorporation clause of our Constitution and through the enactment in 2009 of the Philippine Act on Crimes against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide and Other Crimes Against Humanity. Second, for the Philippines, as set out in its Revised Penal Code, the general rule is that jurisdiction is territorial. Therefore, universal jurisdiction is an exception, grounded on the imperative need to preserve international order. It allows any State to assert criminal jurisdiction over certain offenses, even if the act occurred outside its territory or was committed by a person not its national, or inflicted no injury to its nationals. ... Philippines' Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... Republic Alt No. 9851 The universal jurisdiction concept in international law was incorporated in our local laws with the enactment of Republic Act No. 9851 or the Philippine Act on Crimes against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide and Other Crimes Against Humanity which was signed into law on December 11, 2009. It is anchored in the principle that the ""most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level, in order to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and this contribute to the prevention of such crimes, it being the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. The law (1) defines and establishes the crimes against international humanitarian law, genocide and other crime against humanity: (2) provides penal sanctions and criminal liability for their commission; and (3) establishes special courts for the prosecution of these crimes and for the States to exercise primary criminal jurisdiction. Chapter VIII on Jurisdiction provides: ""Sec 17. Jurisdiction. - The State shall exercise jurisdiction over persons whether military or civilian suspected or accused of a crime defined and penalized in this Act, regardless of where the crime is committed, provided, any one of the following conditions is met: (a) The accused is a Filipino citizen; (b) The accused, regardless of citizenship or residence, is present in the Philippines; or (c) The accused has committed the said crime against a Filipino citizen.

Jurisprudence In Bayan Muna vs Romulo, although the main issue involved in this case is the RP-U Non-Surrender Agreement, the Supreme Court has the opportunity to state that genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity have attained the status of customary international law. Some even go as far as to state that these crimes have attained the status of jus cogens which relate to the principle of universal jurisdiction. Under this principle, any state may exercise jurisdiction over an individual who commits certain heinous and widely condemned offenses even when o other recognized basis for jurisdiction exists. The rationale behind this principle is that the crime committed is so egregious that it is considered to be committed against all members of the international community and thus granting every State jurisdiction over the crime. RA No. 9851 enumerated several treaties to be applied in its interpretation, thus: ""Sec 15.

According to Article 113 of the Polish Criminal Code, the Polish criminal law applies to certain acts of Polish nationals or foreigners committed abroad. This responsibility is not dependent upon the act being punishable in the place of its commitment. It is however limited to two categories of acts. The first group comprises crimes which Poland is obliged to prosecute on the basis of international treaties. The second group covers crimes defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court. A foreigner is prosecuted unless he is extradited. The second provision to be mentioned is Article 112 of the Polish Criminal Code. It penalizes certain acts of Polish nationals or foreigners which were committed abroad. This responsibility is also not dependent upon the act being punishable in the place of its commitment. It is however limited to five categories of acts. They may be summarized as acts contrary to the interests of the Polish State and they include: crimes against the security of Poland, crimes against important economic interests of Poland, crimes giving rise to economic benefits on the Polish territory, as well as crimes against the Polish official agencies and crimes connected with false statements made to such Polish official agencies. ... This solution can be qualified rather as an example of the so called protective jurisdiction than universal jurisdiction. The same qualification can be extended to Article 110 para. 1 of the Polish Criminal Code. According to it: “The Polish penal law shall apply to the foreigner who committed abroad an offence against the interests of the Republic of Poland, the Polish national, Polish legal person or Polish organizational unit that is not a legal person, and to the foreigner who committed abroad a terrorist offence”. This responsibility is however limited to acts which are crimes in the place of their commitment. Last but not least to mention is paragraph 2 of Article 110. According to it: “The Polish penal law shall apply in case of committing by a foreigner abroad of an offence other than set forth in paragraph 1, if the offence is penalized by Polish criminal law with a penalty exceeding 2 years of imprisonment, and the perpetrator is staying in the territory of the Republic of Poland and was not decided to be extradited.” The precondition of the criminal accountability is that the act in question is also penalized in the place of its commitment. This provision could be qualified as an example of universal jurisdiction. ... As to the question of practical application, it must be said that Article 110 para. 2 of the Polish Criminal Code is applied very rarely. It forms rather a safety valve than the part of everyday work of the Polish judges or prosecutors. ... Poland's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2015) ... Poland belongs to a group of states which opt for a wide scope of jurisdiction. In particular article 110 of the Polish Criminal Code provides that the Polish criminal law applies to foreigner who committed abroad an offence against the interests of the Republic of Poland or of the Polish nationals. The same Article indicates that the Polish criminal law shall apply to foreigners who committed abroad another offence. Four conditions must be present for such responsibility to take place. Firstly, a given offence must be penalized by the Polish criminal law with a penalty exceeding 2 years of imprisonment. Secondly, it must be penalized in the state in which it was committed. The third condition is that the perpetrator remains in the territory of the Republic of Poland. The last condition is that the perpetrator is not to be extradited. ... Poland's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2013) ... Let me also stressed that Poland generally applies the principle of territorial jurisdiction (to offences committ4d in the territory of the Republic of Poland) or personal jurisdiction (to offences committed by Polish citizens abroad). However, Poland also applies the principle of universal jurisdiction in limited cases: the Article 113 of the Polish Penal Code states firmly that, regardless of the law operating at the site of the committed offence, Polish penal law shall apply to the Polish citizen and to any foreigner facing extradition when they committed an offence abroad, in circumstances where Poland is obliged to prosecute the crime under international conventions. In practice this is us! ally restricted to the most serious crimes (like war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide etc). In accordance with article 110 paragraph 1 of the Polish Penal Code: ""The Polish penal law shall apply to the foreigner who committed abroad an offence against the interests of the Republic of Poland, the Polish citizen, Polish legal person or Polish organizational unit that is not a legal entity, and to the: foreigner who committed abroad a terrorist offence"". Finally, in accordance with. paragraph 2 of the same Article: ""The Polish penal law shall apply in case of committing by a foreigner abroad an offence other than set forth in paragraph 1, if the offence is penalized by Polish penal law with a penalty exceeding 2 years of imprisonment, and the perpetrator is staying in the territory of the Republic of Poland and was not decided to be extradited."" ...

Romania ratified the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Court by Law No. 204 of 2005. At the time the Rome Statute was ratified, two constitutional issues were debated: -The immunity of the Head of State and of Members of Parliament: Romania interprets the constitutional text on immunity as endowing the Head of State and Members of Parliament with immunity in exercising their functions; however, perpetrating the acts set out in the Rome Statute is not part of those functions. There is thus no contradiction between the Romanian Constitution and the obligations that Romania has undertaken in ratifying the Rome Statute; -Surrender of own nationals: at the time of ratification, Romania accepted the difference between “surrender” and “extradition” as provided for under article 102 of the Statute; Romania therefore considered that the constitutional prohibition on extradition of own nationals does not apply in the case of “surrender” to the International Criminal Court.

Rwanda itself has universal jurisdiction over any crime falling within the category of international or cross-border crimes such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, torture, money laundering, piracy, drug trafficking, etc. It is worth mentioning that in the exercise of its universal jurisdiction, the President of the Supreme Court of Rwanda may, in the interest of justice and with a view to harmonize universal jurisprudence, seek cooperation from the United Nations, international organizations or a member state in which the crime was committed, to provide foreign judges to sit with their Rwandan counter parts to hear such cases. He may also request letters of rogatory from foreign courts to conduct some investigations on behalf of Rwandan Courts. ... Another gap and practical problem in the effective exercise of universal jurisdiction is the lack of universally accepted and clear definition of universal jurisdiction. The definitions proposed by different scholars seem to suggest that there is consensus among the scholastic opinion as to overall depiction of universal jurisdiction, but that there exists a continuing debate over issues such as 1) whether the presence of the accused in the state exercising universality is required, 2) whether some ""connecting link"" with the sate seeking to utilize such jurisdiction is mandated, and 3) to which international crimes universal jurisdiction may be applied. Referring to the first issue addressed above, it remains unclear whether or not the prosecution of the accused in absentia is allowed. The experience of international tribunals and domestic courts would be helpful to clarify this issue. The general rule is that in criminal proceedings the presence of the accused is mandatory. However, this is not absolute. The rationale for this rule is to secure the fair trial requirement stipulated to, not only in international instruments, but also probably in the criminal statutes of almost every state. Particularly, Article 14 of International Covenant on Civil and political Rights, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the relevant statutory articles of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), all encapsulate this norm. States are reluctant to exercise universal jurisdiction in absentia. Such a strict requirement may preclude the effective exercise of universal jurisdiction. The position of Rwanda on this issue is that there should be a fair balance and ""the meaning of this right to fair trial is not to be interpreted too literally."" In this regard, we support the position of ICTR in Barayagwiza case, where the ICTR Chamber concluded that neither the refusal of the accused to attend his trial nor the absence of his council might preclude the proceedings against him provided that they were ""duly informed of his on-going trial."" Thus, whenever a state seeking to utilize universal jurisdiction duly informs the accused, or a state that is anticipated to provide 'secure heaven' to the perpetrator of the crime falling under the domain of universal jurisdiction, may warrant criminal proceedings without violating the above-mentioned right to fair trial. Another issue that attracts attention is whether some ""connecting link"" between the alleged perpetrator and the state seeking to utilize such jurisdiction is required. Such a link is used to justify the territorial principle of criminal jurisdiction: a state seeking to prosecute the accused can do so only if there is a connection to the state. The link can be found either in the form of passive or active personality principle. The former implies that the victim of the alleged crime be of the nationality of the state wishing to exercise jurisdiction while the latter connotes that perpetrator of the crime should be a national of the prosecuting state. Thus, such a link is required for the exercise of jurisdiction based on the territorial principle. Another version of jurisdiction is based on the protective principle, meaning jurisdiction for acts committed abroad that could affect the security of the state. Once again, a state-perpetrator nexus is alleged. But, universal jurisdiction, as the term itself suggests, is rather different from these three types of jurisdiction It should be noted that exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction based on passive and active personality principles must not be confused with universal jurisdiction. By its very nature the universal jurisdiction is different from criminal territorial jurisdiction; and as such it does not require any link to justify the exercise of this jurisdiction. The Princeton Principles on universal jurisdiction, being ""a progressive restatement of international law on the subject of universal jurisdiction,"" in the subsection 3 of principle 1 stipulates that a state may seek the extradition of the accused of the crime under international law without further requirement of any connection to the state. This subsection, supported by the general principle of law aut dedere aut judicare, supports the proposition that link for the exercise of universal jurisdiction is not required. ...

Considering that the exercise of universal jurisdiction by Member States remains a necessity for the fight against impunity for mass atrocities, Senegal has integrated it into its internal legal system by law n°2007-05 of February 12 2007 amending the Code of Criminal Procedure and relating to the implementation of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court Through this text of law, the Senegalese courts are competent to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide, as well as terrorist acts. Similarly, Law No. 2018-03 of February 23, 2018 on the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism enshrines a quasi-universal jurisdiction in its article 130. It allows Senegalese courts to try any person, individual or moral person, prosecuted on the basis of the offenses it has provided for, when the place of commission is located in one of the territories of the States Parties to the Treaty of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) or to the Treaty of West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), or in a third State, when for the latter case, an international Convention grants them jurisdiction. Furthermore, Senegal is a signatory to several international legal instruments which encourage each State Party to have jurisdiction which would allow it to deal with a certain number of offenses whose perpetrator is on its territory and who is not extradited. Examples include the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its additional protocols, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Senegal's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2020) ... The criminal jurisdiction of Senegalese courts has long been based on the criteria of nationality and territoriality. Articles 664 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which regulate criminal jurisdiction, also require that the principle of dual criminality be satisfied when the offence committed abroad is classified as an ordinary offence, unless the victim is of Senegalese nationality. In the first case, an official complaint by the country where the offence was committed is still necessary. The principle of universal jurisdiction was introduced into Senegalese criminal law pursuant to Act No. 2007-05 of 12 February 2007, by which the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended and which concerned the implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. This text confers jurisdiction on Senegalese courts over the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes referred to in articles 431-1 to 431-5, as well as the terrorist acts referred to in articles 279-1 to 279-3 and 279-5. Along with the establishment of the Extraordinary African Chambers, the Act made it possible to try Hussein Habré, whose case was previously considered to be outside the jurisdiction of the Senegalese courts ... Senegal is also a signatory to several international legal instruments that encourage each State party to establish its competence to exercise criminal jurisdiction over a certain number of offences when the perpetrator is present in its territory and it does not extradite him or her. Examples are the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (art. 9.2), the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (art. 7.4), the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (art. 15.4) and the Protocols thereto, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (art. 42.4). There is thus a legal framework for the adoption by the State of Senegal of legislative measures that would confer on the criminal courts jurisdiction over offences committed abroad, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators, provided that they reside in its territory and it has decided not to extradite them. ... Senegal's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2017) ... 1. Universal jurisdiction in Senegalese domestic law The principle of universal jurisdiction was introduced into Senegalese law by Act No. 2007-05 of 12 February 2007 amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, concerning the implementation of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court. Pursuant to article 669 of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure, “any foreign national who, outside Senegalese territory, has been accused of committing or aiding in the commission of any of the crimes mentioned in articles 431-1 to 431-5 of the Criminal Code, an offence against the security of the State or forgery of the State seal or national currency, or of the acts referred to in articles 279-1 to 279-3 and 295-1 of the Criminal Code, may be prosecuted and tried under Senegalese law or laws applicable in Senegal if he or she is arrested in Senegal, if a victim resides in Senegalese territory or if the Government secures the alleged offender’s extradition.” Senegalese lawmakers have thus not limited the exercise of universal jurisdiction to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Other crimes and offences, including offences against the security of the State, forgery of the State seal or national currency, acts of terrorism, attacks, plots and other crimes against the authority of the State or the integrity of the national territory, crimes likely to disrupt public order and acts of torture, may also give rise to the exercise of universal jurisdiction by the Senegalese courts. It should be noted that Senegalese law stipulates that universal jurisdiction may be exercised only if the alleged offender is present in Senegalese territory having been arrested in or extradited to Senegal, or if one of his or her victims resides in Senegal. Thus, the law clearly states that the exercise of universal jurisdiction is limited to situations where the alleged perpetrator is present in Senegalese territory or a victim resides in Senegalese territory. While the new text of article 669 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was adopted to implement the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court, it has been strengthened by the accession of Senegal to a number of other international instruments concerning matters liable to warrant the application of universal jurisdiction. 2. International instruments applicable under Senegalese law Pursuant to article 98 of the Senegalese Constitution, any international treaty ratified by Senegal constitutes an integral part of its domestic law and, consequently, is binding on the Senegalese authorities. There are therefore many instruments that could give rise to prosecutions under universal jurisdiction by the Senegalese courts. They are: • The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted in New York on 10 December 1984 and ratified by Senegal on 21 August 1986; • The four Geneva Conventions of 1949; • The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, ratified by Senegal on 24 September 2008; • The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and ratified by Senegal on 4 August 1983; • The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted in 1998. Senegal has been able to exercise universal jurisdiction on the basis of that domestic and international framework. 3. Practice of Senegalese courts with regard to universal jurisdiction Senegal prosecuted, convicted and sentenced the former dictator of Chad, Hissène Habré, on the basis of universal jurisdiction. On 30 May 2016 he was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of torture, including rape, and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Extraordinary African Chambers. [Original Text] ... Considérant que l’exercice de la compétence universelle par les Etats membres demeure une nécessité pour la lutte contre l’impunité des atrocités de masse, le Sénégal l’a intégré dans son dispositif juridique interne par la loi n°2007-05 du 12 février 2007 modifiant le code de procédure pénale et relative à la mise en œuvre du Traité de Rome instituant la Cour Pénale Internationale. A travers ce texte de loi, les juridictions sénégalaises sont compétentes pour connaître des crimes de guerre, des crimes contre l’humanité et du crime de génocide, ainsi que des actes terroristes De même, la loi n° 2018-03 du 23 février 2018 relative à la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme consacre une compétence quasi-universelle en son article 130.

The defendants in trials under the Law have been those found in the territory of Serbia and not indicted by the neighbouring countries, with no trials held in absentia.

Sierra Leone only embraces a form of universal jurisdiction for grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their 1977 Additional Protocols through the Geneva Conventions Act, of 3rd December 2012. The Act also provides for offences and penalties for other violations of the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols In this vein, concerning grave breaches, the Act covers not only offences committed by citizens of Sierra Leone or criminal conduct carried out on our territory; it also extends to persons of “whatever nationality” committing those enumerated offences whether “within or outside [of] Sierra Leone”. Furthermore, section 2(5) of the Act permits our national courts to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law by providing for such “[w]here a person commits an offence under this section outside Sierra Leone that person may be tried and punished as if the offence was committed in Sierra Leone”. ... Sierra Leone's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2019) ... With regards to the status of international law in Sierra Leone, our country approaches the issue from the dualist perspective. This requires that national legislation be passed to incorporate international law into our domestic system, without any formal rule of hierarchy as between treaties or customary international law. The 1991 Constitution, currently in force, provides in Section 40(4) for the ratification by Parliament of treaties, agreements or conventions executed by or under the authority of the President. In this regard, Sierra Leone domestic law recognizes a form of universal jurisdiction for grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I, which are war crimes, irrespective of the nationality of the perpetrator or the place of commission of the crimes under Part II of the Geneva Conventions Act of 20 December 2012. The High Court of Sierra Leone is clothed with jurisdiction to try an offence committed under section 2 of the Geneva Conventions Act 2012, but there has been no judicial application of the principle in Sierra Leone under the said legislation to date. Sierra Leone is also a party to a number of other multilateral treaties that require Member States to prohibit certain international and transnational crimes in their national law. This includes the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which addresses the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. National legislation has not been adopted in respect of some of those conventions. Those instruments would in any event provide for a treaty-basis for any such crimes, and in some cases for instance the hijacking of aircraft, may not necessarily be considered universal jurisdiction offences as such. ...

At the Diplomatic Conference in Ljubljana in May this year after two weeks of intense negotiations, 68 States present at the Conference adopted the Ljubljana-The Hague Convention on International Cooperation in the Investigation and Prosecution of the Crime of Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, War Crimes and other International Crimes. The convention will serve as a tool that will strengthen the common framework of substantive criminal law provisions and international cooperation tools thus allowing its States Parties to efficiently act against individuals who may not otherwise be held accountable for the most heinous crimes. I would like to thank all states being present at the Diplomatic Conference in Ljubljana for their constructive approach and representatives of International Organizations and civil society for their valuable contribution to adopt this important treaty. The Ljubljana-The Hague Convention, with its well-defined procedures for mutual legal assistance and extradition, is the legal basis that will, for the first time in history, allow countries to expeditiously cooperate with each other on a systematic basis in the prosecution of the most serious international crimes. This is therefore a key instrument that will enable States to effectively exercise universal jurisdiction. ... Slovenia's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2016) ... Although no criminal cases on the basis of universal jurisdiction have taken place in Slovenia, our national legal order accepts that customary international law and treaty law are the main guiding sources in defining crimes that by their nature can be tried under universal jurisdiction. We recognize that customary international law permits exercise of universal jurisdiction over the most serious crimes under international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture and piracy. In addition, numerous treaties oblige states parties to empower their criminal justice system to exercise jurisdiction over crimes defined in those treaties, although this obligation extends only to the exercise of such jurisdiction when a suspect is subsequently present in the territory of a forum state. The relevant provisions in Slovenian law on universal jurisdiction are found in the second and third paragraphs of Article 13 with conditions for prosecution stipulated in Article 14 of the Criminal Code. The law does not contain a list of crimes for which the principle of universal jurisdiction can be applied. The second paragraph of Article 13 concerns the prosecution of a foreigner who commits a crime abroad, is apprehended in the territory of Slovenia and is not extradited to a foreign country. The third paragraph of Article 13, however, applies in the event that a foreigner commits a crime abroad which under international treaty or general principles of law recognized by the international community can be prosecuted in all countries, irrespective of where it is committed. This latter category of crimes, i.e. prosecution under the third paragraph of Article 13 , is, however, possible only with the approval by the Minister of Justice, whereas prosecution under the second paragraph of Article 13 is subject to the approval by the Minister of Justice in the absence of double criminality and with the proviso that, according to the general principles of law recognized by the international community, the offence in question constituted a criminal act at the time it was committed. This inclusion of the safeguard in the form of the authorization of trials under the principle of universal jurisdiction reflects the understanding of the need for a necessary degree of caution when applying the principle of universal jurisdiction against interpreting the suitability of the application of the principle too extensively. The application of the principle of universal jurisdiction under paragraph 2 of Article 13 is further limited in the following situations: □ if the perpetrator has served the sentence imposed on him in the foreign country or if it was decided in accordance with an international agreement that the sentence imposed in the foreign country is to be served in Slovenia; □ if the perpetrator has been acquitted by a foreign court or if his sentence has been remitted or the execution of the sentence has fallen under the statute of limitations, however, under Article 96 of the Criminal Code the statute of limitations is excluded in case of a prosecution or enforcement of sentences for crimes for which the Criminal Code allows life imprisonment, for offenses from Articles 100 to 105 of the Criminal Code, which includes genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, or for those offenses for which the statute of limitations under international agreements is not possible; □ and lastly, if, according to foreign law, the criminal offence concerned may only be prosecuted upon the complaint of the injured party and the latter has not been filed or has been withdrawn. Slovenian Criminal Procedure Act stipulates procedural rules that are equally applicable in the context of the principle of universal jurisdiction, ensuring recognized standards of due processes, including the rights of the accused. In consideration of time, I will only highlight a procedural rule on trials in absentia, which in effect prohibits trials in complete absence of the defendant. The relevant rule is found in Article 307 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which allows a trial to be held when a duly summoned defendant fails to appear at the main hearing but only if his presence is not indispensable, if his defense counsel is present at the trial and if the defendant has already been heard. The related yet separate rules on immunities are contained in Article 6 of the Criminal Code. According to the said provision, the application of the Criminal Code is prohibited for acts of persons whose criminal liability is excluded due to immunity under the provisions of the constitution or rules of international law. ... Slovenia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2010) ... The Republic of Slovenia ratified the Rome Statute on 22 November 2001. After depositing the Act of ratification with the Secretary General of the UN on 31 December 2001, it has become the 48th State party to the Statute and fifth state from the Group of Eastern European States to ratify the treaty. It has also adopted relevant national legislation implementing the Rome Statute. Upon ratification, Slovenia had to change its Constitution to enable extradition of Slovenian https://asp.cc-cpi.int/sites/as.. citizens to the ICC. Further information is in the answer to question (vii). On question (v): Slovenia has adopted special implementing legislation in combination with incorporation of the articles of the Rome Statute into pre-existing law. It has also amended the constitutional provision regarding extradition (Article 47 of the Constitution). The majority of the provisions of substantive criminal law set out in the Rome Statute of International Criminal Court had already been part of Slovenian Criminal Code. The Code was amended once after the entry into force of the Rome Statute (Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 40/2004). On 20 May 2008 the Republic of Slovenia adopted a new Criminal Code, which is published in the Official Journal no. 55/2008. The criminal offences over which the ICC has complementary jurisdiction and which are set out in Article 5 of the Rome Statute have been fully incorporated in the new Criminal Code from 2008 (Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 55/2008). They are included in Chapter Fourteen (of the Specific Part of the Code) in its Articles: Article 100 Genocide Article 101 Crimes against Humanity Article 102 War crimes Article 103 Aggression","An injured person can file a criminal complaint or a private prosecution (Criminal Code (2008), Chapter V, art. 52 ss) Criminal Code (2008) Article 6 Exclusion of Personal Application ...

It is recalled that some conduct violates not only the domestic legal order of a State, but also the international order, with the result that broad agreement exists about the international crimes under customary international law which are the core crimes to which universal jurisdiction applies: piracy, slave- trading, war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and torture.

The Implementation Act incorporates the substantive crimes into domestic law and incorporates aspects related to cooperation with the Court in Chapter 4, Parts 1 and 2. ... South Africa's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2018) ... South Africa has previously indicated that it has enacted legislation that provides for universal jurisdiction over certain crimes inter alia war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Our laws allow for conditional universal jurisdiction and provide that an accused must be present in the territory of South Africa in order to be prosecuted. However, in relation to the investigation of crimes, our Constitutional Court has ruled that presence is not a requirement for investigation and that anticipatory investigation does not violate fair trial rights of the suspect or accused person. Whilst universal jurisdiction can play an instrumental role in combatting impunity, it also brings with it certain practical challenges. In relation to anticipatory investigations, one faces the challenge that a state may become inundated with requests to investigate a host of offences with no indication that the accused may ever enter the territory of that state. This places an immense burden on criminal justice systems where resources are oftentimes already constrained. Furthermore, in order to successfully prosecute an accused, it is imperative that appropriate cooperation and support is provided. If universal jurisdiction is only to be invoked as a last resort, when another state, which would ordinarily have jurisdiction, is unwilling or unable to prosecute, the  question arises, to what extent would such a state that is unwilling or unable to prosecute be in a position to provide assistance, for instance by collecting and sharing evidence? In this regard, South Africa is one of several states that are actively involved in the international initiative to develop a multilateral convention focused on mutual legal assistance and extradition for serious international crimes. Such a convention would prove to be particularly beneficial in securing mutual legal assistance from states when carrying out prosecutions as it will at least place an international obligation upon parties to cooperate with the state exercising universal jurisdiction. ... South Africa's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2017) ... The key to determining whether a criminal prosecution or a civil case for damages can actually be brought based on universal jurisdiction will be the laws of the particular country in which the case is brought. Most states, including South Africa, will not try a person for an international crime unless the conduct has been criminalized under domestic law. As such. South Africa has enacted quite a number of pieces of legislation that provide for some form of universal jurisdiction. They are as follows: the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act, 2002, the Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act, 2004, the Civil Aviation Offences Act, 1972, the Nuclear Energy Act, 1999 and the Implementation of the Geneva Conventions Act, 2012. They all incorporate a wide range of international crimes created by treaties into South African domestic law, and these treaties oblige State Parties to either prosecute or extradite offenders. South Africa has also adopted legislation providing for extraterritorial jurisdiction over mercenary activities and foreign military assistance, provided that there is a jurisdictional link to South Africa {Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, 1998). In a recent case in the Gauteng North High Court, Southern African Litigation Centre v National Director of Public Prosecutions and Others (case No 77150/09 (2012)), it was found that the South African authorities are, in terms of the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act and the Constitution under an obligation to investigate, and if appropriate, prosecute, foreign nationals allegedly responsible for torture of their fellow citizens in their countries, on the jurisdictional basis of the alleged perpetrators' presence on South African territory, confirming that the limited universal jurisdiction principle applies in South African law. ...

In accordance with the Spanish Constitution of 1978, the Spanish Courts adopted an Organic Law the sole article of which authorized the Government to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which was signed by Spain on 18 July 1998. Spain adopted a standard to regulate cooperation with the ICC, namely, Organic Law 18/2003 of 10 December on cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Spain's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2016) ... Legal Rules Spanish law provides for the principle of universal jurisdiction, although its scope has been limited in recent times as a result of the legislative reforms adopted in 2009 and 2014. In its original formulation, article 23, paragraph 4, of Organic Act No. 6/1985 of 1 July on the Judiciary (hereinafter referred to as Organic Act No. 6/1985)1 recognized the jurisdiction of Spanish courts over offences committed by Spanish nationals or foreigners outside the national territory, where those acts are classified as one of the following offences under Spanish criminal law: genocide; terrorism; piracy or unlawful seizure of aircraft; counterfeiting of foreign currency; crimes related to prostitution; trafficking in psychotropic, toxic or narcotic drugs; or any other crime which should be prosecuted in Spain pursuant to an international treaty or agreement. ... As illustrated, the jurisdiction of the Spanish courts thus became dependent on the existence of a link with Spain, which could be based on the presence of the perpetrator in the national territory, the Spanish nationality of the victims or any other “relevant link” with Spain. In addition, taking into account the doctrine established by the Constitutional Court and the case law of the Supreme Court, the principle of subsidiarity was established, in accordance with which the Spanish courts may exercise jurisdiction only if the offences are not being investigated and prosecuted effectively by another country or by an international court. Moreover, proceedings already initiated in Spain must be temporarily stayed if proceedings connected with the same offences are initiated by a court in another country or an international court. ... Organic Act No. 1/2014 once again increased the number of offences subject to prosecution under the principle of universal jurisdiction, for instance, by extending the list of offences involving violence against women beyond genital mutilation and adding offences involving corruption of public officials or organized crime. On the other hand, it maintained the requirement of a link with Spain (to be established on a case-by-case basis); upheld the principle of subsidiarity, which is implemented by specifying to which country’s courts the Spanish courts would cede jurisdiction, unless the State in question is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation; and introduced a new procedural restriction in accordance with which the legal standing to initiate proceedings is limited to the victim and the Public Prosecution Service ... Judicial practice With regard to judicial practice, it should first of all be noted that Spanish judges and courts have applied article 23, paragraph 4, of Organic Act No. 6/1985 with some frequency. Attached hereto are several pages from the book La jurisdicción universal y su aplicación en España. La persecución del genocidio, los crímenes de guerra y los crímenes contra la humanidad por los tribunales nacionales (Universal jurisdiction and its application in Spain. The prosecution of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity by the national courts) (2009) by Professor Antoni Pigrau Solé, which provide an account of the cases brought before and declared admissible by the National High Court of Spain on the basis of universal jurisdiction over cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Secondly, it should be noted that criminal proceedings in many of those cases did not progress very far because of three types of circumstances: (i) the accused persons enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction by virtue of their status as current or former Heads of State, Heads of Government or Ministers for Foreign Affairs (as in the cases of Paul Kagame, Fidel Castro, Hassan II, Teodoro Obiang Nguema and Hugo Chávez); (ii) the Spanish Government decided to extradite the accused to their own countries, where criminal proceedings against them were under way (as happened with Ricardo Cavallo and Juan Carlos Fortea, for example); or (iii) a third country decided not to comply with an extradition request issued by Spain (as happened with Augusto Pinochet and the military personnel implicated in the Guatemala case). In fact, the case of Argentine military officer Adolfo Scilingo was the first (and, to date, the only) case to result in convictions from both the National High Court (in 2005) and the Supreme Court (in 2007). It is also worth noting that at times the application of universal jurisdiction has been a source of tension and disagreement between those two courts. For instance, in the Guatemala case concerning the genocide of the Mayan people, the Criminal Division of the National High Court in 2000 rejected the existence of Spanish jurisdiction, considering it to be subsidiary to the jurisdiction of Guatemala, whose courts were not unable to prosecute (although up to that time they had not done so). That order was appealed to the Supreme Court; the Court’s Criminal Division annulled the order in its judgment of 25 February 2003 but applied an even more restrictive interpretation of the principle of universal jurisdiction, ruling that universal jurisdiction could not be exercised in the absence of a link with Spain, namely the presence of the accused in the national territory, the Spanish nationality of the victims or some other link. Both decisions, which, it should be noted, were adopted before the 2009 reform, were annulled by the Constitutional Court, which recalled the absolute terms in which article 23, paragraph 4, of Organic Act No. 6/1985 (in its original version, at that time) enshrined universal jurisdiction (judgment No. 237/2005 of 26 September 2005). Lastly, it should be noted that proceedings in the Spanish courts have been adjusted in line with the legislative changes set out above. In that regard, as mentioned above, an immediate consequence of the reform introduced by Organic Act No. 1/2014 was the stay of the Tibet case (National High Court Criminal Division Order No. 38/2014 of 2 July 2014, confirmed by Supreme Court Criminal Division Judgment No. 296/2015 of 6 May 2015), the Falun Gong case (National High Court Criminal Division Order No. 44/2014 of 15 July 2014, confirmed by Supreme Court Criminal Division Judgment No. 297/2015 of 8 May 2015) and the Rwanda case (National High Court Criminal Division Order of 28 January 2015, confirmed by Supreme Court Criminal Division Judgment No. 551/2015 of 24 September 2015), in accordance with the transitional provision of the Act.","Public Prosecutors Spanish law also allows private persons to initiate criminal proceedings through the action civile mechanism.

Has your Government adopted any national legislation implementing the Rome Statute (“the Statute”), or otherwise enacted legislation pertaining to the Rome Statute? Yes. In implementing the Statute, did your Government draft a stand-alone legislation or did it incorporate the articles or substantive provisions of the Statute into pre-existing law? The Act on Criminal Responsibility for Genocide, Crimes against humanity and War crimes (2014:406) entered into force on 1 July 2014 (since 1 January 2022 renamed as the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Certain International Crimes). The purpose of introducing the act was, among other things, to ensure that the crimes covered could be prosecuted in Sweden to at least the same extent as at the International Criminal Court. The act introduced new penal provisions on crimes against humanity relating to certain specified acts when they constitute or form part of a large-scale or systematic attack directed against a civilian population. The penal provision on genocide builds on the underlying rules of international law. The provision on violations of international law in Chapter 22 Section 6 of the Criminal Code was repealed and replaced by a clearer regulation of criminal responsibility for war crimes. Attempt, preparation, conspiracy to, and failure to disclose offences under the act were criminalized. A provision was also introduced to the effect that, under certain conditions, military and civilian superiors may be regarded as perpetrators of offences under the act that are committed by subordinates. In addition, a special criminal responsibility was introduced for military and civilian superiors who have failed to control subordinates or who have failed to report genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes committed by subordinates. Genocide, crimes against humanity and gross war crimes, as well as attempts to commit such crimes, were exempted from statutes of limitations (regulated in the Swedish Criminal Code). Furthermore, universal jurisdiction for Swedish courts was introduced for all offences under the act (regulated in the Swedish Criminal Code). On 1 January 2022, legislative amendments entered into force enabling Sweden's accession to the so-called Kampala amendments regarding crimes of aggression and certain other amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. A special criminal responsibility for the crime of aggression was introduced in Swedish law in the act on criminal responsibility for certain international offences. A person who is able to exercise control over or direct the political or military actions of a State and who plans, prepares, initiates or carries out an act of aggression which, by its nature, severity and extent, constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations can be convicted of the crime of aggression. The punishment is imprisonment for a fixed term, a minimum of four and a maximum of eighteen years or for life. With respect to requests for international legal cooperation (surrender, legal assistance, enforcement), the Cooperation with the International Criminal Court Act (2002:329) designates the Swedish Ministry of Justice as the channel for communications from and to the Court. For all other matters related to the ICC, the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs is responsible for communications with the Court. Sweden consider the Statute fully implemented in national legislation. [Recent Statements before the UN Sixth Committee given on behalf of the Nordic countries and do not identify specific substantive national law related to the scope and applicability of the principle of universal jurisdiction.] Sweden's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2013) ... Sweden exercises universal jurisdiction over crimes against international law (i.e. criminal jurisdiction based on the nature of the crime, irrespective of its location and of the nationality of the alleged perpetrator or victim). 1 International crimes are defined as ""a serious violation of a treaty or agreement with a foreign power or an infraction of a generally recognised principle or tenet relating to international humanitarian law concerning armed conflicts""' in the Swedish criminal code. Thus, treaties as well as customary international law concerning international humanitarian law are applicable in the determination of whether a crime against international law has been committed. In addition to crimes against international law, Sweden also exercises universal jurisdiction, inter alia, over the crime of genocide'. In order to initiate proceedings for international crimes which are not implemented into Swedish national law, like crimes against humanity, the offence in question must ,fall within the scope of Sweden's national criminal law. Sweden can exercise universal jurisdiction over such crimes if the least severe punishment prescribed for the crime in Swedish law is imprisonment for four years or more. Since 1986, Sweden is party to the Convention against Torture and Swedish courts may exercise universal jurisdiction over the crime of torture, if the offence in question amounts to a crime under ordinary Swedish law and the least severe punishment prescribed for the crime in Swedish law is imprisonment for four years or more (e.g. extremely gross assault). It shall be noted that prosecution over crimes against international law that have been committed outside of Sweden require the authorization of the Swedish government.' ... Sweden's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2011) ... Sweden ratified the Rome Statute on 28 June 2001 and the ratification had unanimous support in the Swedish Parliament. The ratification and implementation of the Statute were dealt with in separate processes. A time-consuming and rather complex element was the translation of the Statute into Swedish. The Rome Statute has been implemented into Swedish law. For the purpose of implementation, the Act on Cooperation with the International Criminal Court (2002:329) has been supplemented by the ordinance (2003:69) containing provisions on the application of the act. The Act covers all forms of cooperation as set forth in Part 9 of the Rome Statute as well as enforcement of sentences, fines, forfeiture and reparation orders in accordance with Part 10 of the Statute. Necessary legislation with respect to the privileges and immunites of the Court in accordance with the Statute and the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court which Sweden ratified on 13 January 2005, is provided in the Act on Immunity and Privileges in Certain Cases (1976:661). In order to fully meet the obligations regarding offences against the administration of justice by the Court (article 70 of the Statute), necessary amendments have been made in the Penal Code and in the Act on Cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Also, amendments have been made in the Penal Code concerning the non- application of the ordinary statute of limitation for the crimes of genocide and crime against international law (which corresponds to war crimes). The Rome Statute does not per se require the implementation of the crimes of the Statute into national legislation. However, Sweden has a strong interest in having legislation permitting prosecution of serious international crimes to the same extent as is possible under the international system which Sweden has promoted. Obligations to criminalize international crimes follow from other international treaties, to which Sweden is a party, and from customary international law. Following a Government resolution of 12 October 2000, a commission was appointed to review Swedish legislation on criminal responsibility for international crimes and jurisdiction over such crimes. In November 2002 the Commission submitted the report International Crimes and Swedish Jurisdiction (SOU 2002:98, Internationella brott och svensk jurisdiktion), which entailed a proposal for amendments of the current penal law. The report has been remitted for comments by public authorities, universities, and non-governmental organisations, and preparations are presently taking place within the Ministry of Justice towards introducing a Government Bill during 2012.","Anybody, including non-governmental organizations, can report an offence in Sweden and under chapter 23, article 1 (1) of The Swedish Code of Judicial procedure the prosecutors are obliged to open an investigation when there is “cause to believe that an offence subject to public prosecution has been committed.""

With respect to offences committed abroad by a person who at the time of the act was a Swedish citizen or habitually resident in Sweden, or when a prosecution is brought is a Swedish citizen or habitually resident in Sweden, the Prosecutor General may refer the examination to another public prosecutor. If there is reason to assume that the examination is of particular importance for Sweden’s foreign and security policy and the Prosecutor General makes the assessment that there is no impediment to bringing a prosecution, the Prosecutor General must, by means of a statement, refer the matter to the Government for a decision.

Swiss courts are presently considering several cases brought against foreign nationals concerning allegations of crimes against humanity and/or war crimes committed abroad. The Federal Criminal Court has conducted its first proceedings on the basis of universal jurisdiction. The defendant, A.K., is a Liberian national. He is accused of committing war crimes in Liberia between 1993 and 1995. The jurisdiction of the Swiss judicial authorities was established on the basis of the presence of the accused, who is a refugee in Switzerland, in Swiss territory, and the fact that he has not been extradited or handed over to a foreign authority or an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction is recognized by Switzerland to be tried for the same offence. It was not easy to conduct the proceedings, as the events had taken place abroad more than 20 years previously and there were certain restrictions in place owing to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation. Once the judgment is issued, it may be appealed. The proceedings in the A.K. case demonstrated once again that cooperation between States in the prosecution of the most serious international crimes is crucial. There were some challenges in arranging to hear the testimonies of the plaintiffs and witnesses under appropriate conditions. However, it was done successfully, as a result of close cooperation between various States. International legal cooperation plays a key role in the collection of evidence. Switzerland is committed to facilitating legal cooperation in relation to the prosecution of the most serious crimes and calls on all States to collaborate in order to promote the success of proceedings. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2020) ... The scope and application of universal jurisdiction in Switzerland For Switzerland, universal jurisdiction is a customary principle whereby a court can exercise its jurisdiction even in the absence of ties between the case and the forum State (territory, nationality of the offender or the victim, attack against the fundamental interests of the State). In the Swiss legal order, universal jurisdiction is a secondary jurisdiction exercised when no other court with stronger jurisdictional ties (territoriality or nationality, for example) can try the offender for the crimes in question. Switzerland subscribes to the “conditional” or “limited” conception of universal jurisdiction, the exercise of which is subject to two conditions: The requirement of “close ties” with Switzerland, which existed for war crimes, was abandoned following the amendment of its civilian and military criminal legislation with a view to implementing the Rome Statute (amendments that entered into force on 1 January 2011). The scope of universal jurisdiction is defined in the general provisions of the Swiss Criminal Code (CP; Recueil systématique 311.0, http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/c311_0.html). Switzerland recognizes and applies the principle of universal jurisdiction for certain offences against minors (art. 5 CP), crimes or offences prosecuted under the terms of an international agreement (art. 6 CP), and particularly serious crimes proscribed by the international community (art. 7, para. 2 (b) and art. 264m CP), namely genocide (art. 264 CP), crimes against humanity (art. 264a CP) and war crimes (arts. 264b to 264j CP). Practice of the judicial authorities Swiss courts are presently considering several cases brought against foreign nationals for allegations of crimes against humanity and/or war crimes committed abroad. The Public Ministry of the Confederation sent an indictment based on universal jurisdiction to the Federal Criminal Court for the first time on 26 March 2019. The case concerns A.K., a Liberian national, who is being prosecuted for war crimes. One case was concluded on the basis of universal jurisdiction by a Swiss military court, when it was still competent to hear cases on the crimes concerned. F.N., a Rwandan national, was convicted of war crimes committed in Rwanda (decision of the Military Court of Cassation of 27 April 2001). ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... III. Examples of international instruments containing one or other form of universal jurisdiction The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984 provides for the possibility of States exercising universal jurisdiction and imposes on States the obligation to prosecute or extradite a person suspected of committing acts of torture who is in their territory. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 also provide for the possibility of States exercising universal jurisdiction and impose on States the obligation to prosecute or extradite persons suspected of having committed a serious breach of the Conventions. Many terrorism-related conventions, for example, the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings of 1997, also provide for the exercise of universal jurisdiction if the suspect is not extradited. IV. Universal jurisdiction in the Swiss legal system Switzerland recognizes and applies the principle of universal jurisdiction in its legal system and has done so for a number of years. Certain acts are therefore prosecuted despite the absence of the traditional jurisdictional links, namely, territoriality (article 3 of the Penal Code), nationality of the perpetrator (article 7, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code), nationality of the victim (article 7, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code) and protection of the fundamental interests of the State (article 4 of the Penal Code). These acts are: crimes or offences against minors (article 5 of the Penal Code), crimes or offences prosecuted under an international agreement (article 6 of the Penal Code) and particularly serious crimes prohibited by the international community (article 7, paragraph 2, and article 264m of the Penal Code). Some countries adhere to an absolute or unlimited interpretation of universal jurisdiction, meaning that it applies even when the accused is not in the territory of the forum State. Switzerland subscribes to the “conditional” or “limited” interpretation of universal jurisdiction, in which the exercise of universal jurisdiction is subject to two conditions: (i) The person suspected of the offence is in Swiss territory; (ii) The suspect is not extradited to another competent jurisdiction. In the Swiss legal system, universal jurisdiction is therefore a jurisdiction exercised subsidiarily, when no other jurisdiction with a stronger jurisdictional link (territoriality or nationality, for example) can prosecute the perpetrator of the crimes in question. Moreover, the exercise of universal jurisdiction is reserved for serious crimes. Other crimes and offences are prosecuted on the basis of the “traditional” principles of jurisdiction (territoriality or nationality, for example). Following the legislative amendments made to the Swiss Penal Code and the Military Penal Code with a view to implementing the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in Switzerland, the requirement of a ""close tie"" to Switzerland for prosecuting war crimes was dropped. The compatibility of this requirement with international law (Geneva Conventions of 1949) was called into question. The legislative amendments entered into force on 1 January 2011. Furthermore, it should be noted that these crimes fall under federal jurisdiction (article 23g of the Code of Penal Procedure) and are prosecuted automatically. This means that the competent authorities may open an investigation as soon as they are notified of the crime. ...","To file a complaint: According to Article 301(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, any person is entitled to report an offense. To bring a claim: Swiss law distinguishes between two types of individuals affected by the crime: (1) a person who suffers any type of direct harm (lésé – injured person) and (2) a person who suffers direct physical, sexual, or mental harm (victime – victim). A victim is considered a sub-category of injured persons who suffers specific forms of harm. NGOs are not considered injured persons or victims and thus have no rights in criminal proceedings.",No,"[Third Party Translation] Swiss Criminal Code (1937, as of 2022) Art. 264n Exclusion of relative immunity The prosecution offences under Title Twelvebis, Title Twelveter and under Article 264k does not require authorisation in accordance with any of the following provisions: a. Article 7 paragraph 2 letter b of the Criminal Procedure Code; b. Article 14 and 15 of the Government Liability Act of 14 March 1958; c. Article 17 of the Parliament Act of 13 December 2002; d.

A framework law (Loi federale de 2007 sur les immunites), is used to determine to whom Switzerland could grant immunities or privileges. Swiss authorities recognize personal immunities for Heads of State, Heads of Government, as well as for Ministers of Foreign Affairs (also referred to as the troika) during the performance of their duties, covering all their acts, including private ones. Such immunity ends with the end of their term, however members of the troika continue to enjoy residual immunity after their term in office for official acts performed during their term of office. In the Nezzar case, the question arose as to whether residual functional immunity covered acts committed outside his term and the Court specified that for acts committed before Khaled Nezzar took office as Minister of Defense of Algeria and for acts committed after the end of his time in office, no immunity applied.",No,N/A,Yes,"Switzerland subscribes to the “conditional” or “limited” conception of universal jurisdiction, the exercise of which is subject to two conditions: i) presence of the suspect in Swiss territory ; ii) the presumed offender has not been extradited to another competent jurisdiction. Swiss authorities have jurisdiction the moment the suspect enters Swiss territory. It is sufficient that the person be present in Switzerland when the prosecuting authorities commence the investigation ; the accused can depart Swiss territory immediately after that and jurisdiction would still remain (Khaled Nezzar case).

International conventions ratified by Togo As a testament to its willingness to work effectively to prosecute serious offences, Togo has ratified a number of international conventions that recognize universal jurisdiction, namely: a- The Geneva Conventions of 1949 ... b- Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984 ... c- International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance of 2006 ... 2. Relevant provisions of Togolese law In the domestic legal order, the new Criminal Code of November 2015 contains provisions that allow Togolese courts to exercise jurisdiction over certain serious crimes committed outside the country. In particular, article 155 states: “The provisions of this chapter shall apply to crimes committed within or outside the country, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or accomplice and of the place where the offence was committed.” The crimes concerned are genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and apartheid. This recognition of universal jurisdiction allows Togo to comply with the values upheld by the international community. An effective reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure will ensure that this issue is taken into account in a comprehensive manner. 3- The practice of Togolese courts Under the new Criminal Code, Togolese courts have jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and apartheid, regardless of the place where the crimes were committed and of the nationality of the perpetrator, accomplice or victim. However, although Togo recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction, no cases have yet been brought before a Togolese court on the basis of this fundamental principle. The capacities of these courts must nevertheless be strengthened to allow them to play their appropriate roles. The principle should be expanded to cover torture, in order to be consistent with the rest of our laws. Lastly, the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction should be organized and circumscribed through the ongoing reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure. ... Togo's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2016) ... My country continues to work for the fight against impunity and the promotion of justice based on fairness. Thus at the international level, Togo, which currently sits on the Human Rights Council, is party to several international conventions containing an obligation to prosecute or extradite in particular the 4 Geneva Conventions of 1949, or the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of 1984. At the national level, the overhaul of the penal code, adopted on 2 November 2015 to replace that of 1980, made it possible to incorporate all the international treaty instruments ratified by Togo to ensure their effectiveness. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984 has, for example, been the subject of a reinforced application with the criminalization of any act of torture provided for in articles 150 and following of the new penal code. At the same time, as part of the process of modernizing justice, sessions of training are regularly organized by the Togolese Government with the support of partners with a view to strengthening the knowledge and capacities of court magistrates and Judicial police officers on international human rights norms and standards in all aspects of the administration of justice. ...","[Unofficial Translation] Criminal Code of the Republic of Togo (Law No. 2015-010 of 24 November 2015) Art. 9: Togolese criminal law is applicable to any crime committed abroad by a Togolese.

Numerous international instruments urge States parties to incorporate into their legal systems the principle of universal jurisdiction, with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators of the crimes provided for in those instruments are pursued and brought before national courts, regardless of the measures traditionally adopted in order to determine international responsibility for such prosecutions. ... 1949 Geneva Conventions and the additional Protocol ... 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ... 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel ... 2006 International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ... 1958 Convention on the High Seas ... 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Tunisia is a party to all the abovementioned instruments, and considers their provisions to be of a national legislative nature, in that, in accordance with the Tunisian Constitution, article 32, they may be directly applied by the national judicial authorities. That article provides that any agreements approved or ratified by the President of the State have greater authority than national laws. Consequently, the authority of such agreements is second only to that of the Constitution, and the judiciary undertakes to apply laws promulgated by the legislative authorities and agreements to which the country is a party in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. ... The Code of Criminal Procedure, article 305, paragraph 1, states that Tunisian citizens may be pursued and prosecuted by the Tunisian courts if they have committed outside the country a crime or misdemeanour punishable under Tunisian law, unless it is clear that the crime is not punishable under the law of the country in which it was committed, or the suspect proves that he has already served the relevant sentence abroad by producing the judgement, showing that he has served the sentence, or is able to demonstrate that the penalty has lapsed with the passage of time or that he was fully pardoned. The Code of Criminal Procedure, article 307, provides that any foreign national who, either as a principal actor or an associate, has committed outside Tunisia a crime or misdemeanour that threatens State security, forged the State seal or counterfeited the State currency may be pursued and prosecuted under Tunisian law if arrested within Tunisia or if the State obtains his extradition. A further provision in the same Code, article 307 bis, paragraph 1, states that anyone who, either as a principal actor or an associate, has committed a crime or misdemeanour outside Tunisia may be pursued and prosecuted by the Tunisian courts if the person affected by that crime or misdemeanour is Tunisian. On the basis of the foregoing, if any public prosecutions are to be brought of crimes and misdemeanours committed in a foreign country, certain conditions must be satisfied, of which the most important are the following: - The laws of the country in which the crime took place must criminalize such acts; - The victim must be a Tunisian national. Under those circumstances, it is permissible under Tunisian law to pursue the perpetrators of crimes committed outside Tunisian territory, provided that there is a strong connection to Tunisia. Given the limited capacity of normal laws to assimilate the principle of universal jurisdiction with regard to serious crimes committed outside Tunisia, the Tunisian legislator has made progress in extending powers to prosecute anyone on Tunisian soil who has perpetrated terrorist crimes or been engaged in money-laundering. Similar progress has been made in respect of crimes committed against maritime and air targets. ... It may be said that Tunisian law has adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction only in the amended rather than the absolute sense, in that it requires a minimum connection to Tunisian judicial authority, including the presence of the criminal on Tunisian soil. The basic aim is to ensure that Tunisian soil is not used as a haven or in order to avoid penalties and that criminals are either prosecuted or extradited, thus responding to the purpose of the principle of international jurisdiction. ...",Public Prosecutors,N/A,N/A,No,N/A,Yes,"[Unofficial Translation] Code of Criminal Procedure (1968) Section 306 No prosecution may be directed against a foreigner for a crime or misdemeanor committed on the territory of the Republic if the accused proves that he was finally judged abroad and, in case of conviction, that he has undergone or prescribed his sentence or obtained his pardon.

The application of universal jurisdiction is provided for in several international conventions (mainly the Geneva Conventions relating to humanitarian law). Turkmenistan is a party to those international instruments and has implemented their basic principles and provisions in its national legislation in keeping with its obligations. 3. Most crimes that are subject to universal jurisdiction violate norms of international law, or international public order (ordre public). They include genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture and acts of international terrorism. Universal jurisdiction is provided for in international treaties (in particular the Geneva Conventions of 1949) and in national law as a possible legal basis for the prosecution of persons who have committed serious international crimes. 5. Turkmenistan has established a robust legal framework in which the main principles of universally recognized international norms have been embedded. For example, in 2010, Turkmenistan adopted its Criminal Code, into which the principle of universal jurisdiction has been incorporated. A working group has been created to draft a new version of the Criminal Code, guided by the humane policies the country pursues, particularly in the area of criminal law. The working group is also considering and studying questions of universal jurisdiction and its further transposition into national law. 6. In the Criminal Code, a series of crimes against peace and the security of humankind are provided for in chapter 21, in particular planning, preparing, unleashing or conducting a war of aggression (art. 167-1); the use of prohibited means and methods of warfare (art. 167-4); violations of the laws and customs of war (art. 167-5); criminal breaches of international humanitarian law during an armed conflict (art. 167-6); failure to act or the issuance of a criminal order during an armed conflict (art. 167-7); genocide (art. 168); participation in armed conflicts or hostilities in foreign States (art. 169-2); and attacks against internationally protected persons (art. 170); No statute of limitations applies to crimes against peace and the security of humankind (art. 74, para. 5) to ensure that no crime against humanity goes unpunished. The following are offences for which universal jurisdiction has been established in the Criminal Code (including other grounds for jurisdiction): trafficking in persons (art. 129-1); torture (art. 182-1); crimes against the foundations of the constitutional system and the security of the State (chap. 22, arts. 171–180); crimes against public security and public order (chap. 29, arts. 271–291); and crimes against public health (chap. 30, arts. 292–310). ... 8. The question of universal jurisdiction with regard to human rights is a timely one. Human rights violations which are subject to universal jurisdiction include genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. Under article 4 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan, people are the most valuable asset of society and the State. The main task of the authorities is to protect, support and serve people. Turkmenistan recognizes and respects the basic democratic rights and freedoms of persons and citizens as adopted by the international community and laid down in international law. Under article 32 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan, all persons have the right to life and the freedom to lead their lives. No one may be deprived of the right to life. The right of all persons to live in freedom is protected by the State on the basis of the law. Turkmenistan has abolished the death penalty. 9. The Criminal Code sets out various categories of punishment for genocide, terrorism, trafficking in persons, torture, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes. For example: -Wilful acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, any national, ethnic, racial or religious group by killing members of that group, causing serious harm to their health, forcibly relocating them, forcibly preventing births, forcibly transferring children, or inflicting other conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction in whole or in part of members of that group, are punishable by imprisonment for a term of 15 to 20 years. If they are committed in times of war, the same acts are punishable by imprisonment for a term of 15 to 25 years (art. 168, on genocide). ... 10. Under the laws of Turkmenistan, amnesties and pardons do not apply to the gravest violations of human rights or norms of international humanitarian law.

The United Kingdom also notes the practical constraints on delivering justice through universal jurisdiction. The primacy of the territorial approach to jurisdiction reflects the reality that the authorities of the State in whose territory an offence is committed are generally best placed to prosecute that offence, not least because of the obvious advantages in securing the evidence and witnesses necessary for a successful prosecution. Consequently, there is only a small number of offences for which the courts in the United Kingdom can exercise universal jurisdiction where there is no apparent link between the crime and the United Kingdom. ... UK's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2019) ... National legal rules and judicial practice in this area, together with relevant applicable international treaties The jurisdiction of the courts in the UK to try crimes is premised on a presumption of territoriality, unless there is express statutory provision to the contrary. However, in those cases in which universal jurisdiction is available, that availability does not mean that such jurisdiction should always be exercised. The United Kingdom has previously highlighted the importance of using procedural requirements to ensure that universal jurisdiction is exercised responsibly, and continues to believe this is an important safeguard. Domestic prosecuting authorities in the United Kingdom would not usually seek to institute proceedings against any suspect who was not present in the jurisdiction, and may need prior permission to proceed. For example, national proceedings for an offence under section 1 of the United Kingdom's Geneva Conventions Act 1957 (i.e. for grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions) can only be instituted in England and Wales with the consent of the Attorney General (who ensures that public interest considerations, including where appropriate considerations of international law and comity, are taken into account before a decision to prosecute is made). There is a small number of offences for which the courts in the United Kingdom can exercise jurisdiction even where there is no apparent link to the United Kingdom. A non-exhaustive list of these offences is included in the Annex to this letter, together with extracts from relevant domestic legislation and references to related treaties. However, the fact that the United Kingdom has decided to provide for such jurisdiction as a matter of domestic law does not necessarily mean that it considers that these offences attract universal jurisdiction as a matter of international law. ... ANNEX ... An offence under section 1 of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 (grave breaches of Geneva conventions): ""Any person, whatever his nationality, who, whether in or outside the United Kingdom, commits, or aids, abets or procures the commission by any other person of [a grave breach of any of the scheduled conventions [, the first protocol or the third protocol] shall be guilty of an offence)"" Related treaties: Geneva Conventions I [article 49], II [article 50], III [ article 129] and IV [article 146]. ... UK's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2017) ... Thirdly, universal jurisdiction is distinct from the extra-territorial jurisdiction enjoyed as a matter of domestic law by the courts of many States in relation to the extra-territorial conduct of their own citizens or residents. In the United Kingdom, the starting point is that the criminal courts enjoy jurisdiction in relation to crimes where a substantial measure of the conduct in question took place within our jurisdiction. However, there are exceptions, including when our courts exercise the jurisdiction, granted to them by the International Criminal Courts Act 2001, over genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed overseas by those who are resident in the UK; and when serious offences, such as murder or serious sexual offences, are committed by British citizens overseas. Mr Chairman, the United Kingdom wishes to stress that it considers the scope of universal jurisdiction to be relatively narrow. It is only established for a small number of specific crimes. The rationale for establishing such universal jurisdiction as a matter of international law is twofold. First, the most serious international crimes affect the international legal order as a whole and, as such, should be subject to the jurisdiction of all States. Offences falling into this category include grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. .... The United Kingdom considers that procedural safeguards must be in place to ensure that universal jurisdiction is exercised responsibly. For example, our prosecuting authorities would not usually seek to proceed against any suspect who was not present in the jurisdiction; and most offences of universal jurisdiction may not proceed without the prior permission of the Attorney General, who ensures that public interest considerations including international comity are taken into account before a decision to prosecute is made. Our Parliament has legislated to confer universal jurisdiction on the courts in relation to certain offences, and so establishing universal jurisdiction before the courts of the United Kingdom is not legally complex. When considering whether to prosecute, the authorities will need to assess whether the accused person enjoys any immunities under international law, and may also need to navigate other practical issues. The latter was the recent experience of the United Kingdom during a prosecution for torture alleged to have taken place outside the United Kingdom. While there were few legal difficulties with establishing universal jurisdiction pursuant to the domestic legislation implementing the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Torture Convention, obtaining evidence and dealing with practical issues such as translation proved to be problematic. ... UK's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2017) ... The International Criminal Court Act 2001 applies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The International Criminal Court (Scotland) Act 2001 applies in Scotland. And the International Criminal Court Act (Overseas Territories) Orders 2009 and 2010 apply in overseas territories. The substantive crimes are incorporated into domestic law in the legislation, but the definitions of the crimes refer to the relevant Articles of the Rome Statute. ... UK's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2016) ... For example, in the United Kingdom, the starting point is that the criminal courts enjoy jurisdiction in relation to crimes where a substantial measure of the conduct in question took place within our jurisdiction. However, there are exceptions, such as when serious offences, such as murder or serious sexual offences, are committed by British nationals overseas. Under the International Criminal Court Act 2001, our courts may also exercise jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed overseas by those who are resident in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom wishes to stress that it considers the scope of universal jurisdiction to be relatively narrow. It is only established for a small number of specific crimes, including piracy and war crimes. ... UK's Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 66th Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2011) ... The United Kingdom considers that under international law, universal jurisdiction in its true sense is only clearly established for a small number of specific crimes: piracy and war crimes, including grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. Universal jurisdiction is permissive, unless a mandatory treaty-based obligation exists to provide for the prosecution these crimes, for example as provided by the Geneva Conventions in respect of grave breaches. In other words, under international law States are entitled, but not obliged, outside of treaty based obligations, ·to assert universal jurisdiction over these crimes. The United Kingdom acknowledges that there is a further limited group of crimes which some States consider to attract universal jurisdiction, including genocide and crimes against humanity, but there is a lack of international consensus on the issue. The following table outlines the domestic law and judicial practice of the United Kingdom relating to international crimes for which universal or extraterritorial jurisdiction has been established. Grave Breaches of the Geneva Conventions Geneva Conventions Act 1957. This Act, as amended, gives the United Kingdom courts jurisdiction over grave breaches of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocol I (the Act applies to a person of any nationality acting in the United Kingdom or elsewhere). The Act was further amended in 2009 to include grave breaches of Additional Protocol Ill in respect of the perfidious use of certain emblems. War Crimes War Crimes Act 1991 provides jurisdiction over war crimes amounting to murder, manslaughter or culpable homicide committed in Germany or German occupied territory during the Second World War by any person, irrespective of their nationality at the time of the crime, who was, or who subsequently became, a British citizen or resident in the United Kingdom. Genocide/Crimes Against Humanity/War Crimes International Criminal Court Act 2001. Provides for jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes when committed outside the UK by UK nationals, residents or persons subject to UK service jurisdiction, including persons who were not UK residents at the time of the offence but who subsequently become UK residents and are resident at the time proceedings are brought. Following an amendment in 2009, proceedings may be brought, subject to certain conditions, in relation to offences committed on or after 1 January 1991. The International Criminal Court (Scotland) Act 2001 makes equivalent provision in respect of Scotland. ... [Other Statements contain similar information]","Crimes of universal jurisdiction can be reported to the police in the same way as any other offence. The war crimes team of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command is responsible for the investigation of all allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and torture. The Crown Prosecution Service, Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division is responsible for prosecuting any such crimes. Both the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution service take their decisions independently. The Victims Code of the UK defines a ‘victim’ is: - a person who has suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss which was directly caused by a criminal offence - a close relative (or a nominated family spokesperson) of a person whose death was directly caused by a criminal offence. You can also receive Rights under this Code if you are: - a parent or guardian of the victim if the victim is under 18 years of age [footnote 5] or - a nominated family spokesperson if the victim has a mental impairment or has been so badly injured because of a criminal offence that they are unable to communicate or lacks the capacity to do so. - All service providers must have the victim’s best interests as their primary consideration and take the victim’s age, maturity, views, needs and concerns fully into account.",Yes,"[Original Text] International Criminal Court Act 2001 23. Provisions as to state or diplomatic immunity (1)Any state or diplomatic immunity attaching to a person by reason of a connection with a state party to the ICC Statute does not prevent proceedings under this Part in relation to that person. (2)Where— (a)state or diplomatic immunity attaches to a person by reason of a connection with a state other than a state party to the ICC Statute, and (b)waiver of that immunity is obtained by the ICC in relation to a request for that person’s surrender,the waiver shall be treated as extending to proceedings under this Part in connection with that request.

(5)The power conferred by section 1 of the United Nations Act 1946 (c. 45) (power to give effect by Order in Council to measures not involving the use of armed force) includes power to make in relation to any proceedings such provision corresponding to the provision made by this section in relation to the proceedings, but with the omission— (a)in subsection (1), of the words “by reason of a connection with a state party to the ICC Statute”, and (b)of subsections (2) and (3),as appears to Her Majesty to be necessary or expedient in consequence of such a referral as is mentioned in article 13(b) (referral by the United Nations Security Council).

It is also possible for an individual private citizen or a private organization or entity to seek a private arrest warrant and bring a private prosecution. However, the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales (the Director of Public Prosecutions) is required before an arrest warrant is issued for grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, torture, and hostage-taking. For a private prosecution, an application for consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions should only be made when there is a reasonable belief that a suspect will be entering the UK within 14 days of the application. Applications for the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions should not be made while there is an ongoing Metropolitan Police scoping exercise or investigation.",Yes,"Presence: A nexus to England and Wales is required in order to open investigations on the above-mentioned crimes committed abroad. The precise nexus required depends on the crime(s) in question. The courts of England and Wales can exercise jurisdiction over the offences of torture and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions committed abroad by any person, independent of their nationality. If the suspect is not already in the UK, but likely to be coming to the UK, the special unit dealing with international crimes at the Metropolitan Police (SO15) prefers to open an investigation before the accused enters the territory, using the prospect of their presence as a ground to investigate. This allows the special unit to build a stronger case and collect evidence, before requiring the suspect’s arrest upon arrival. However, for an arrest warrant to be issued and for the suspect to be charged, the suspect must either be present or their presence anticipated. The courts of England and Wales can exercise jurisdiction over the offences of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed abroad by any person who: (i) is/was a UK national or UK resident at the time of the crime; or (ii) became a UK national or UK resident after the crime and still resides in the UK when proceedings are brought. If the suspect is/was a resident but is not currently present in the UK, the actual or reasonable prospect of his/her return to the UK will be sufficient for an investigation to be initiated.

Nevertheless, Law No. 18026 (Annex II), of September 25, 2006, was enacted in order to reaffirm and establish cooperation procedures with the International Criminal Court (hereinafter ICC), in addition to those already provided for in the Rome Statute. This law had broad support within the political system and among civil society. With its enactment, Uruguay was the first State in Latin America to fully implement its obligations regarding the repression of war crimes. The bill's introductory portion refers to general principles, including the imprescriptibility of the aforementioned crimes, the inadmissibility of amnesties, and provisions regarding due obedience and other exemptions, as well as the hierarchical responsibility of superiors. The second part describes not only all conduct that violates article 8 of the Rome Statute, but also serious violations of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I that are not contemplated by that article of the Statute. The text of the law also includes rules to prosecute several of the violations of international treaties that limit certain methods or means of combat and include provisions to punish conduct contrary to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. It also sets the minimum age for participation and recruitment or enlistment of children at 18 years of age in accordance with the provisions of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and its international commitments. Likewise, Uruguay was the first country in Latin America to approve the amendments to the Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted at the Review Conference held in Kampala (Uganda) in mid-2010. These amendments were unanimously approved both in the Chamber of Senators and in the Chamber of Representatives in June 2013, and on September 26 of that same year their instrument of ratification was deposited. The Crimes provided for in the Rome Statute are fully operational in Uruguayan Law since Uruguay ratified the aforementioned instrument (on June 28, 2002), however, they were reiterated in Law 18026 on Cooperation with the ICC (25 September 2006) - which classifies crimes against humanity in articles 18 and subsequent articles; crimes of genocide in articles 16 and 17, and war crimes in article 26, as well as other crimes.

This, Chairperson, is well within our rights and obligations under article 4(h) of the Constitutive Act of the African Union. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2017) ... Zambia recognises that the international community cannot rely on the mere goodwill of states to guarantee the prosecution of perpetrators of such atrocious crimes as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, slavery and torture. These ore of such exceptional gravity that it requires an appropriate legal framework that compels or empowers countries to ""either extradite or prosecute"". There is no question, therefore, that all Member States should ensure the domestication of relevant treaties, and/or the enactment or expansion of universal jurisdiction statues. To this extent, Zambia has ratified and domesticated a number of Treaties, such as the SADC Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance, the SADC Treaty of Extradition and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crimes, among others. Zambia is also making strides in ensuring that national laws incorporate the principle of universal jurisdiction. With regard to terrorism, Zambia has  enacted the Anti-Terrorism Proliferation Bill of 2018, which repeals the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2007. Section 68 (1) of the Act grants the Attorney-General discretionary power to have regard to international law, practice and comity, even where there is no extradition agreement in force between the Government of Zambia and another concerned State. Zambia is also willing to enter into and facilitate cooperation agreements with foreign authorities and law enforcement agencies in ensuring perpetrators of terrorism are brought to justice. Furthermore, Zambia recognises and acknowledges the important role that universal jurisdiction plays, and has commenced the process of drafting the International Criminal Court Draft Bill to domesticate the Rome Statute, not only as an affirmation of Zambia's confidence in the International Criminal Court but also to ensure universal cooperation in curbing crimes that have universal implications. Zambia urges Sates to enhance the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction as complementary to national criminal jurisdictions and encourages further cooperation between the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. ... Statement before the UN Sixth Committee of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly on the scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (October 2016) ... Zambia remains dedicated to ensuring that those who commit offences that are abhorrent to the collective conscience of the international community and that infringe upon international public policy are answerable for those offences. Zambia however firmly believes that international efforts to combat international crime should complement domestic legal regimes, hence the need to strengthen domestic legal frameworks to facilitate the legitimacy exercise of the Universal jurisdiction. Zambia hopes that this discourse will prompt the review of respective statutes deal adequately with the question of Universal Jurisdiction. ... Zambia's Plan of Action for the Assembly of States Parties for achieving implementation of the Rome Statute (2012) ... Zambia further wishes to report that it has held consultations with stakeholders within the country with a view to implementing the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Subsequent to these consultations, the Ministry of Justice is in the process of drafting the International Criminal Court Bill 2012. The Bill seeks to establish the International Criminal Court in Zambia, provide for investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes and crime of aggression, provide for cooperation with the International Criminal Court and implement the Statute of the International Criminal Court of 1998. Due to the change in Government, the approval in principle given by Cabinet for the drafting of the Bill has lapsed. It has, therefore, become necessary for the Ministry of Justice to seek a fresh mandate from Cabinet to proceed with the draft Bill. The aim of the revision is to bring the Bill in line with the new political dispensation in Zambia. Zambia, however, remains committed to the full implementation of the Rome Statute. It is anticipated that the revised Bill will be brought before Parliament in 2013 for consideration and passage into law",Public Prosecutors,N/A,N/A,No,N/A,No,N/A,N/A,,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,
