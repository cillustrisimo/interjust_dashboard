            <h2>What are the different ways States can investigate and prosecute crimes that occurred outside their own borders?</h2>
            <p>States can invoke several types of jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes that were committed outside their own borders. With the exception of absolute universal jurisdiction, each of these bases for jurisdiction relies on the existence of some type of "link" between the prosecuting State and the crime committed, such as the nationality of the alleged perpetrator or victim, or the presence of the alleged perpetrator on the prosecuting State's territory. In order for a State to investigate and prosecute extraterritorial crimes, the State must first pass a law that recognizes one or more of these jurisdictional bases.</p>

        <section class="narrative-block-lower">
            <p>Absolute universal jurisdiction is the "purest" form of universal jurisdiction, reflecting the original idea behind the principle that certain crimes are considered to be committed against the international community as a whole. In many States, laws granting jurisdiction over the most serious international crimes committed abroad are subject to a significant limitation: the suspected perpetrator must be physically present in that State to trigger jurisdiction. This limitation, commonly referred to as "conditional universal jurisdiction,"<sup><a href="#ref-34" class="ref-link">[34]</a></sup> is often motivated by resource constraints which justify focusing on those perpetrators who are actually present on the would-be prosecuting State's territory.</p>
            <p>Most States exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by their nationals, regardless of the place of commission. This is commonly referred to as "active personality" jurisdiction. Some States interpret this type of jurisdiction to include alleged perpetrators who are residents, refugees, or stateless persons residing permanently in that State.</p>

            <p>Many States are required to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad as an obligation under a treaty. Most relevant for Project Meridian, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which govern the conduct of war and provide protections for those who are not taking part in hostilities, include an obligation to prosecute suspected war criminals or extradite them to a State that is better placed to prosecute.<sup><a href="#ref-54" class="ref-link">[54]</a></sup> Therefore, any State that has ratified the Geneva Conventions has not only jurisdiction but an obligation to investigate and prosecute "grave breaches" of the Conventions committed in other States.</p>
            <p>Some States can exercise jurisdiction over crimes that affect their sovereignty, security, or national interest, or simply over crimes that they consider to be committed against their country. This is commonly referred to as "protective principle" jurisdiction. While this type of jurisdiction could in theory extend to the most serious international crimes which are seen to affect the interests of all countries,<sup><a href="#ref-52" class="ref-link">[52]</a></sup> States rarely invoke it to investigate and prosecute such crimes.<sup><a href="#ref-53" class="ref-link">[53]</a></sup></p>

            <h2>How frequently do States apply universal jurisdiction?</h2>
            <p>While most States have laws that allow them to investigate and prosecute crimes committed beyond their own borders, few have actually done so. This gap is due to a variety of procedural and practical limitations, including special requirements that can make it difficult to trigger jurisdiction, capacity issues among national authorities, and lack of political will. Underutilization of these laws represents a significant missed opportunity to pursue accountability on behalf of survivors and families of victims of atrocity crimes</p>

One of the key barriers that explains this gap is the legal limitations which effectively make universal jurisdiction much less universal than it was meant to be. Two such limitations are that many States require that the alleged perpetrator be present on their territory to open an investigation, and sometimes political authorization to initiate a prosecution.</p>
            <p>Another challenge related to this gap is the perception it creates of the selective application of universal jurisdiction, and international criminal law in general. While the use of laws to investigate and prosecute extraterritorial crimes has been expanding geographically in recent years,<sup><a href="#ref-55" class="ref-link">[55]</a></sup> most serious international crimes cases (246 out of 270) have been opened in Europe against perpetrators from outside the continent.<sup><a href="#ref-56" class="ref-link">[56]</a></sup> This trend and the lack of prosecutions of suspected perpetrators from certain Western States undermine the universality of the international justice system.<sup><a href="#ref-57" class="ref-link">[57]</a></sup> Further geographical expansion of prosecutions is critically important for the system's future credibility and success.</p>

        <section class="narrative-block-lower">
            <p>Beyond legal limitations, additional barriers to more widespread application of universal jurisdiction are lack of capacity and political will among national authorities. Investigations of the most serious international crimes often require more specialized expertise and resources than investigations of other offenses, and many States are hesitant to spend what limited resources they have on lengthy investigations of crimes that took place outside their borders. States may also face political pressure from other States not to carry out prosecutions at all.<sup><a href="#ref-58" class="ref-link">[58]</a></sup></p>
            <p>An increase in recent years in the number of specialized units dedicated to international crimes as part of police and prosecutorial teams is a sign of growing commitment among States to combatting impunity for the most serious international crimes. Additionally, collaborative platforms such as the European Network for the investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes within Eurojust have been created "to enable close cooperation between the national authorities [of EU Member States] when investigating and prosecuting" such crimes.<sup><a href="#ref-59" class="ref-link">[59]</a></sup> However, more work needs to be done to build this type of investigative and prosecutorial expertise outside of Europe, and to combat the lack of political will that often impedes the opening of serious international crimes cases in the first place.</p>

            <p>Despite limitations and challenges, the possibilities for prosecuting alleged perpetrators of the most serious international crimes at the national level are significant and expanding. Developing and supporting this system will enable effective access to justice for thousands of survivors. It will also ensure that a wide range of perpetrators who are currently outside the reach of the International Criminal Court can still be brought to account.</p>
            <p>Project Meridian provides comprehensive and transparent information to help survivors and practitioners make the most of these expanding opportunities. Equally, the Project has identified some of the main obstacles to realizing the promise of universal justice. The information collected and tracked by Project Meridian can help advocates, practitioners, and government officials turn this promise into a reality.</p>
